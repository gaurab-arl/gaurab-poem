    poem: `
    A quiet room inside her
filled with unshed tears,
where every sound arrives late
and leaves early.

Natural beauty-superficial
too attractive to bear,
No one learned the story,
only practiced objectification

door shuts, murmurs circles
no knocks, direct infiltration.
pity stares fill the air
thorns between earnest feeling,
and no hands to steady her.

    poem: `
    I enjoy the warmth,
the way you look at me
like I’m made of morning.
But I never asked you
to dig so deep.

You follow me into stories
you tell yourself,
mines filled with meaning
I didn’t bury.
I watch you search
while I keep moving.

Your memories blur,
rearrange themselves
until I fit the shape
you need me to be.

    description: "A reflection on the pursuit of an idealized illusion and the realization of reality.",
    poem: `She enjoyed her time,
while being a sunlight.
You dive after her
into an imaginary mine,

where every moment
contradicts her story,
yet you wait
for a beautiful,
illusionary obsession

We humans want to
possess an unreal goddess,
so we align stories,
tilt thoughts - 
maybe it’s possible
for you all
to possess her.

The illusion stands so close
it feels like it could be mine.
She keeps wandering, living - 
the illusion keeps shifting - 
at last, her place
is reality, not imaginary.

    poem: `my lungs fill with water,
a silent tune rings—
i almost stoped,
to breath.

I never learned to swim,
but still I want to float.

Sometimes it lets me float.
Sometimes it drags me down.

Each time I struggle,
it ends with final
peace.

I wanted to see the ocean
even when it pulled me under
I suffocated to the last breath
thinking it was only a dream `

    poem: `A group started talking,
and I sat beside,
outside the circle
not ignored, not included,
like a planet in a distant 
but near.

I chose observation
over interruption.
And yes - I wrote a poem after.
I can’t name who inspired it,
but it holds the shape
of how I notice you.

Now, let's just leave it there--.`

walking the same roads,
smiling on cue
so no one would ask
why I was always behind.

I wanted to leave quietly,
but leaving made me the villain.

Staying erased me.
Leaving condemned me.

So I learned
how to disappear

they forget.
I stand where
I don’t meet
their passing glances.

Memory burnt out,
name forgotten.

Nothing is broken,
neither body

And yet, while living,
I can’t find
a single soul.

I can’t say,

Console me."

It's an illness

death shall
grant salvation
as redemption.

Who is pretending -
the one that lives,
or the one that thinks?

Eyes couldn't see -
Too vast to count,
every step a grant
of obliteration.

I am left
with only this:
silent counting.`

    poem: `when a flower reaches its peak,
it dies the next week.

but I seem to be immortal
no matter how much time passes,
I can't seem to change a thing.

in a secular world
where I made my home,
where everything was dead,
yet I was not alone.

neither soul nor ghost was present,
only a person
I created with thought.

we didn't speak a thing,
yet we understood each other,
remembering only our names,
that was our eternity.

when you can't connect,
nothing matters
where you stand.

so, I created a friend of me,
and sometimes it struck me
am I living or nonliving?

I really admire her within me,
she cares for no one but me.
though I may not be qualified,
but she is still me.`

    poem: `To the person I admire:
When the wind turns cold,
I see the sun.

Even when you go unseen,
I look, I fall
Quietly, into your eyes.

And there, a glance carries warmth,
A smile holds enough to undo winter

though we pass without a word.
A silent smile,
A silent goodbye.`

engagement full,

She came

passed by some,

remembered none.

When? Who?
The past crawls back.
Regret—full,

    poem: `Witty one around me, I keep,
Playful whenever she speak.
Revealing her deeper thoughts—
When she talks, she never stop.

Flirtatious in a teasing way,
Maintains control of how much she shares.
Enjoys unpredictability, smile on face,
Silly girl, she even forgets my name.

Appreciated for her sharp personality
As much as her looks—sweet as a cake.
She drifts like the restless wind,
Unable to keep her in a place.`

    poem: `A disturbing sight 
Created waves unknown.
When they struck something emotionless,
A spark ignited,
And fire came to life.

Something hidden from all —
Then I came to see.
At first unsure,
Maybe I just never noticed.

But slowly, the veil was removed.
My eyes lit up — And I realized:
It was a beautiful story.

It held a word
Not found in my dictionary.

A path familiar,
But never quite aligned.
I kept seeking that spark,
Longing to see
What always struck me —
Without my knowing.

Someone looked around…
Saw something no one else tried to.
A shadow by side —
Like the Tao.

One side was bright,
The other, dark within.
What bound them?
Not love —
But the hum of bees.

A binding light between two souls,
Two crescent moons combined
To form a full one.
Yet still — a hole in the middle.
And to fulfill it…

It needs a child —
Carrying new life.`

    poem: `Old lady vibes, age thirty-two mentally,
Nowadays it's up, maybe forty-eight.
Hidden like candies, looks like a child,
Time for retirement? Nah, still wild.

Alone in room thinking a game 
Tea cup in hand, rolls eyes gently.
Laughs at chaos, but keeps it in line,
"Too old for drama," yet younger than time.

A model or blonde? No one can say,
Remembers her old self, a scary dare day.
Counting candles but forgetting the count,
A treasure of secrets, never spells them out.`

    description: "A brutal, visceral poem about cruelty, greed, and human nature.",
    poem: `On a bed, you seemed to fall,
Beneath the sky that witnessed all.
Face covered in blood that flowed like tears,
Alone in a room that silenced ears.

A haunted laugh rang sharp and clear,
Like a witch mid-ritual, drawing near.
Couldn't tell who was friend or foe—
They all took part in the sacred show.

A piece of flesh laid bare for feast,
Like beggars starved for centuries at least.
Snatch, kill, devour—even if none to share—
Tender, bloody meat—how delicious, how unfair.

Eyes veiled in scarves of greed, pride, envy,
Sins committed with joy, in a place once holy.
Why dream of heaven, when we hide our disgrace?
All we demand, yet nothing we place.

Just trying to shield a burning tail,
In search of water, found a poisoned grail.
We all crave life, yet thrive in the killing—
Is it habit… or the nature we're born with?`

    description: "A confession of guilt, fear, and silent emotional distance.",
    poem: `The rain, the cold drops and this bizarre wind
Will they ever return to the place they were
I already know—then why do I lie?
Lies, more lies, it's losing the sincerity at this moment.

Why? I wonder – whispering this again & again
Is it fear, fear of losing—never mind
Fear or something within
Oh dear—your bright smile
Why does it dim in my sight?

Every time we cross paths
That happy eyes, fades away.
As a silent loss
A silence so loud that I can hear 1000s of words

I know it right? right?
Deep down in my heart, besides the covers
I know it's me right.
And hence I drowned
More, more & more I kept sinking

Oh dear, I wish I could say I hope
But how,
Uttering the words, feels like a sin
As I know I committed a crime.`

    poem: `The way I see her — an inspiration for living,
A story without end, an unforgettable dream.
Whenever she arrives, chaos crawls behind,
And I become her shield,
Willing to shatter just to keep her with me.

Playfully flirtatious, untamed like the wind,
Yet guarded — perhaps afraid of being seen too deeply.
She hides real feelings behind jokes and emojis,
Unique, always shifting, always surprising.

Sarcastically charming, yet personally racist,
Likely loved for her personality,
Not just her beauty — though that's in her genetics.
It's just her being funny — my old lady.`

    poem: `Not everything can be seen,
Not everything can be peeled,
Sometimes we just appreciate it.
Better not to know,
Even when known, better not to show.

Eyes show what the mind thinks.
We dip into reality,
Then back to unrealistic dreams.

Shrouds kept shifting,
And we stood at the center:
One unmoved,
The other vanished,
Nowhere to be seen.`

    poem: `The child I became,
The person she made,
The devil I turned into—
Still with her all care.

I pray to demons,
She prays to God.
A change began in me
As I started to fall.

The devil
Helped me descend,
But as she prayed to God,
He pitied seeing my fall.

What's left in me?
I am lost.

The feeling of loss
Occurs when I'm alone—
Like a breeze, like a weight,
I begin to free fall.

The room I was kept in
Is now filled with water—
I can't see a thing.
I was never meant to drown,
But I still try to swim.

The things I ignored,
Calling them small,
Now I do them.

All of them feels like,
Flood,
Coming my way,
I seem to realize,
The pain you felt.

Now I understand
The helplessness you hid.
The pain of losing—
I feel it now.

What will be left of me
When I see you
Leaving?`

A mess of my making, everything dire,
Can't sit still, death the only dear.

    poem: `The shadow moved, but the man didn't.
He was looking at the sky, feeling something.
A thought in his head was playing music,
Images constantly shifting and dancing.

He had completely lost the reality he was in.
Knowing or not, he walked slowly
Happiness on his face, sadness in his eyes,
Firm steps forward toward the sky.

Leaving the ground, something he loved
He lost his balance, without support.
He started falling, reaching for something to grip,
But only emotions remained…
And now, he is slain.`

new to learn, old mistakes in repetition.
The loneliness, part of the cycle,
diving deeper… deeper.

I saw the eyes of dying men,  
one looked at me and smiled,  
thinking:"I was just like you once—  
now, I leave it all behind."

The past is dead, just like me.  
Living today, to die tonight.  
Just drink hot water, stay still—  
tomorrow, everything will be fine.`
