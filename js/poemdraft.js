    poem: `Once a day, a demon comes to play,
He lives inside a deep-held well.
When I try to sleep, he wakes,
And asks about my miserable day.

I plead, but he just grins,
Staring at how vulnerable I am.
We wrestle till the dead of night,
In morning, He just fade away.

I searched for him in every place,
Found nothing—till I faced my chest.
A shelter I built to hide the pain,
Tonight again—he comes to play.`

    description: "About someone unreachable, existing more in memory and dream than reality.",
    poem: `You’re so distant,
in a realm none reach,
hovering, picking flowers,
no one to see.

I looked at a feather,
tried to catch it, it floats.

Maybe it’s fate to watch you go,
though I want to savor the hidden truth.

In memory, no one stays;
cold dew on my face.
sadly, It was a dream,
from the previous day.`

    description: "A fragmented, cinematic dream of beauty, distance, and silent witnessing.",
    poem: `A girl beneath the fading sun,
Where mountain and river runs.
Her playfulness - a warm light,
Tamed wind to aid her flight.

Behind the ridge, a leaning man,
A drunk, lost in thought.
Beautiful night with fairy gone,
Maybe it's a blessing for her.

I Dreamed beneath a starlit sky,
A bride who smiled, eyes as stars.
Then came - a peerless man like,
A king with light in binding ties,
And me—an attendant, with teary eyes.`

    tag: "almost-love",
    description: "About imagining closeness while remaining silent and distant.",
    poem: `a group of four people,
two girls, two boys
I was included as well,
as time passed slowly.

a strange feeling came to me,
like someone in a relationship,
though the girl stood in front of me,
I could only keep gazing.

it felt like an affair,
when her eyes locked into mine.
though it was only imagination,
I found it quietly lovely.

sometimes she called my name;
I seemed to listen,
but I didn’t understand a thing.

I felt lost in her presence,
wandering without direction.
it was a place where
I stayed quiet, not talking.`

    title: "When She Offered Her Hand",
    tag: "regret",
    description: "A moment of contact that feels more like pity and fear than love.",
    poem: `When she offered her hand,
I grasped it firmly, softly.
Mine was cold; hers was the opposite.

Maybe it’s my luck—
I kept holding,
afraid to let go,
then started holding tightly.

Though I looked in her eyes
and saw a spark,
it couldn’t be love;
it seemed more like regret.

I must be a plague
that she keeps avoiding.
Somehow, showing pity,
she still kept me in.`

    description: "On outliving meaning and failing to blend into the world.",
    poem: `some died at twenty.
I lived a year or two more.
they lived to find
the meaning of living.

I lived to deny the truth.
I can’t seem to relate
people around me expecting
me to follow their way.

no matter where I go,
I can’t blend in.
the ground I lived on,
I never saw the world.

some exist in dreams,
some in reality.
I breathe to live,
but I am not a person anymore.`

    description: "About continuing to exist while feeling already dead inside.",
    poem: `haunted by my writing
scared by thoughts
in a sea of peace
I suffered, lost a lot

some came to take me
some left behind
as I continue to live
I feel like a corpse

I listen very well
neither talk nor see
just like a dream
came and go as please`

    description: "Short encounters, forgotten moments, and the return of regret.",
    poem: `Temporary fate,
engagement full,
a short period
called fun.

She came
they came,
passed by some,
tinkered with moments,
remembered none.

When? Who?
The past crawls back.
Regret—full,
cure: none.`
