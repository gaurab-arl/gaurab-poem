    poem: `
    nourishment 

I sold my mental state
People bought it to read
an enjoyment to some
a nourishment to some.

I was made the cause
of every misbehavior,
the very curse
that defines me,
forces hiding
in the dark.

A breakdown into particles
where images remind me
of a place I don’t belong

but I wanted some.

    poem: `
    A gap between us, 
even unknowingly,
expected something.

An occurrence,
certain but small
an accident got them all.

Humans expected sympathy
where people had none.

i too am statue
i only stare , 
listen, 
think.

at time need
my hand 
it was gone.

    poem: `
    A shared memory,
never a story,
confined in
a place.

Even then,
some to left,
some to right,
some in front

in seconds, scattered.
Where I returned
to myself.

to origin,
to a hut for none.
Corners hugged
a part of me,
the rest was sold
to some.

    poem: `
    

I didn’t
offer a hand,
nor did they ask.

We laughed,
smiled even then—
the mind constant,
tinkering with pain.

Named ‘friend’,
yet frozen in place.
Thought raced,
but the body lost
the game.

Some dared;
they left the place.
I, a hole of water,
avoided by fate.

I breathe just enough  
to qualify as alive.

I show up—  
they forget.  
I stand where  
I don’t meet  
their passing glances.

Memory burnt out,  
name forgotten.  
I wasn’t a human,  
just a passing fate.

    poem: `
Alone, a person on the phone,
miles from the death door.
A man sits beside an oasis,
a soft tone in the wind.

When he tries to look,
she hides away her phone.

New faces, each on every head,
still looking for a place to stay.
She seems to change every day.

I had thought to begin alone,
but she chose to talk with me
that very day.

Everyone included, finally
i was an afterthought.
seem invisible, but
still cause other pain.

    poem: `Once a day, a demon comes to play,
He lives inside a deep-held well.
When I try to sleep, he wakes,
And asks about my miserable day.

I plead, but he just grins,
Staring at how vulnerable I am.
We wrestle till the dead of night,
In morning, He just fade away.

I searched for him in every place,
Found nothing—till I faced my chest.
A shelter I built to hide the pain,
Tonight again—he comes to play.`

    poem: `You’re so distant,
in a realm none reach,
hovering, picking flowers,
no one to see.

I looked at a feather,
tried to catch it, it floats.

Maybe it’s fate to watch you go,
though I want to savor the hidden truth.

In memory, no one stays;
cold dew on my face.
sadly, It was a dream,
from the previous day.`

    poem: `A girl beneath the fading sun,
Where mountain and river runs.
Her playfulness - a warm light,
Tamed wind to aid her flight.

Behind the ridge, a leaning man,
A drunk, lost in thought.
Beautiful night with fairy gone,
Maybe it's a blessing for her.

I Dreamed beneath a starlit sky,
A bride who smiled, eyes as stars.
Then came - a peerless man like,
A king with light in binding ties,
And me—an attendant, with teary eyes.`

    poem: `a group of four people,
two girls, two boys
I was included as well,
as time passed slowly.

a strange feeling came to me,
like someone in a relationship,
though the girl stood in front of me,
I could only keep gazing.

it felt like an affair,
when her eyes locked into mine.
though it was only imagination,
I found it quietly lovely.

sometimes she called my name;
I seemed to listen,
but I didn’t understand a thing.

I felt lost in her presence,
wandering without direction.
it was a place where
I stayed quiet, not talking.`

    poem: `When she offered her hand,
I grasped it firmly, softly.
Mine was cold; hers was the opposite.

Maybe it’s my luck—
I kept holding,
afraid to let go,
then started holding tightly.

Though I looked in her eyes
and saw a spark,
it couldn’t be love;
it seemed more like regret.

I must be a plague
that she keeps avoiding.
Somehow, showing pity,
she still kept me in.`

I lived a year or two more.
they lived to find
the meaning of living.

I lived to deny the truth.
I can’t seem to relate
people around me expecting
me to follow their way.

no matter where I go,
I can’t blend in.
the ground I lived on,
I never saw the world.

some exist in dreams,
some in reality.
I breathe to live,

neither talk nor see
just like a dream
came and go as please`

engagement full,
a short period

She came
they came,
passed by some,
tinkered with moments,
remembered none.

When? Who?
The past crawls back.
Regret—full,
cure: none.`
