Flooded Silence

The moments I wanted to spend with you all —
They burn within me
Like a volcano
Waiting to erupt.

But…
The fear whispers:
“You will be left alone
In the search for them.”

I have a child within me, too —
Curious,
Craving to explore.
But chains bind it.

Each moment I try to create.
Create a dead end for me
How do you solve it

The demons in me
Remind me,
“You never deserved
Those things.”

I try to pray to God,
To ask for forgiveness…
But I stumble,
Again and again.

Maybe He thinks
I’m just
Wasting His time.

I long for something—
Something to spark me,
To begin a new journey.
But finding such a soul
Feels like
Rain in a desert.

Always dry.
Even when I want to cry,
My eyes remain closed —
Tears trapped inside.
And now,
I am filled with flood.

When I open…
I flood with it 
And take everything
With me.
