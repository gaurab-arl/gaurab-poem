shadow of a soul—
who would it be dark or bright
sometime i think its me , without any form
but thats the ilussion i created for 

a light need darkness to shine
if darkness left  , its scorching bright 
i dont think i can be any 
as the will desprise within me 

maybe like a orphan child 
would sacrifice but whats left for me 
now i dont think i can try 
a fool falling from height , will just die 

on a rainy day— rain drop touched me
it was an acid that burned me 
standing on a plane nowwhere to hide
someone was small child with loost sight

though sky cleared with me burned 
thinking the wrong deed i commited 
maybe that was the returbutation i face
a peace of mind i found with crying aloud

shadows of ten with me
some where bright and dark 
i mixed with you without begin part
without any color to repreent , me an outcast

a fake smile for  shadow
cant be more generous than that
dont know whats real smile 
pain with mouth streched left and right
