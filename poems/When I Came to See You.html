The One I Remembered

The era I once remembered—
Is gone.
The person I saw—
Is gone.
The daylight—
Where the sun was none.
            
Called “Miss,” to see...
Was that the person I had once known?
            
Riding a dark horse,
In black clothes—
That was my signature.
I came to meet an old friend—
Who was already gone.

The promise we kept
Was the thing remembered
Alongside you.
Now you’ve left me—
When I came to see you.

Was I the only one
Ever truly by your side?
I met your granddaughter—
She remembers you,
Through me.

The things remembered
Were the uniqueness you held.
You would have been perfect—
If only you hadn’t dressed so bad.

The song playing in the background—
It was beautiful.
I searched for it.

May you rest in peace.
And know—
I will always remember.  
                                                                                                                                                      </div>
