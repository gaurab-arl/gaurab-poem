        <div class="poem-content">

A veil all girls wear,
Like bonnets hiding
Their tender faces.

A warm silk thread,
Fine piece of cloth—
Wrapped 'round a goddess's gaze
And sacred air.

A sweet, fine poison—
She spoiled the silence
When she spoke.
Like wine, she slipped away.

The veil was lifted,
The mask removed—
Once your hiding place.
And what did I saw?
An old face.

Yet,
Beneath it all,
A real person lingered.
So aged you seemed,
With a soul of dying flame.

New to strangers,
Old to the old—
I think now,
You were never gold.

Just silver—
Yet I hold to you,
Like a tale
Where an axe is cast
Into a wind-blown stream.

As soft as you were,
As thorny as you grew—
I’d never seen that side.
Even though it was you,
It hurt me.

To have you—
A blessing,
Perhaps a goddess by my side.
But you’d leave me
On my worst days,
Return only when
I’d stitched my wounds.

What can I say to you?
Just one truth you must know:
You kept spamming my thoughts—
And still, I was never bored.
Because that was the only time
You truly saw.
