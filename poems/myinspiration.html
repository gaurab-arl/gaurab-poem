Filled with belonging, with my story
She fell like a dream yet to be fulfilled.
Full of love, of cuteness, of laughter and light
A girl who came to soothe my silent ache with care.

On a journey we walked; I wished to carry her weight.
Her shiny face, those long lashes, her curly hair
So serious at times, yet she'd mock my foolish ways.
A playful date, a genuine smile lighting her face.

We talked without worry, as if time had paused.
At a crossroad, she pulled me back from behind.
Afraid of losing her, I held on tight
Together we crossed, yet the end felt close.

In the end, I left— fearing my inner self.
Hesitation filled my heart where she resides.
She was a chapter that slipped away,
With a call, I assured myself—the hesitation that killed me.
