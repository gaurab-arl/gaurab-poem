        <div class="poem-content">
A peaceful day — with you in my grave,
You in my arms, and I in yours.
In this accursed world, only you cared.
The rest — like wolves, starved for years.

This year, something struck me hard,
Distorted the way I used to think.
A temporary gem I once held dear —
Now, with time…
I kept it for years, only to throw it away.

In this vast universe, I am but an ant,
So small, so easy to erase.
I only wanted to admire its beauty —
Without makeup, just… nature and bare.

Worried about everything — except me.
But I already got the answer,
Even if you never shared it.

We search for someone shaped in our minds —
You found yours——I lost mine.
Still, I’m just an ant.

Existing only through nature’s belief.
Don’t look at my path —
I follow, I swallow.
A road into the void I walk,
Searching for something…

But in the end,
We both lie still, in each other’s arms —
Just locked away,
With the memories we shared in my graveward.
