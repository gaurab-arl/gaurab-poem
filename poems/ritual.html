Crying Mother on Her Fall

On a bed, you seemed to fall,
Beneath the sky that witnessed all.
Face covered in blood that flowed like tears,
Alone in a room that silenced ears.

A haunted laugh rang sharp and clear,
Like a witch mid-ritual, drawing near.
Couldn’t tell who was friend or foe—
They all took part in the sacred show.

A piece of flesh laid bare for feast,
Like beggars starved for centuries at least.
Snatch, kill, devour—even if none to share—
Tender, bloody meat—how delicious, how unfair.

Eyes veiled in scarves of greed, pride, envy,
Sins committed with joy, in a place once holy.
Why dream of heaven, when we hide our disgrace?
All we demand, yet nothing we place.

Just trying to shield a burning tail,
In search of water, found a poisoned grail.
We all crave life, yet thrive in the killing—
Is it habit… or the nature we’re born with?
