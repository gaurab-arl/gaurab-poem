O dear...
Frustration is all I see,
Anxiety is what I feel,
Depression is all I get.

A moment of silence
Is my only friend.

Sometimes, I question myself —
Where is the greenery?
I should find.

How much do I wish to suffer,
To be alone for eternity.

Left in imagination,
Dreamed of a girl —
The girl I loved,
The girl who loved me.

The crying face I want to see,
The feeling I want to feel,
Me consoling you,
A dream never wanted to end.

Lost in thoughts of you,
Still thinking,
Please accept me.

Am I a boring person?
Or did you just not care to talk to me?

Failed to see,
Failed to feel,
Failed to be happy,
Failed to be the person you wanted me to be.

If I confess,
Will you accept me?

If yes —
It will be a beautiful story.
If no —
It will be another lonely me.

The feelings I hide
Are suffocating me.
Slowly, my breath is draining,
Slowly, my vision is closing —
I am dying from the pain ,
I am feeling.

I failed in everything.
It’s not the will to win —
I simply didn’t succeed.

The failure scared the hell out of me.
I couldn't be with you anymore,
Because I can't handle my inner self.

The day you didn’t talk to me,
I felt lonely.
Seeing you talk to another boy happily,
I felt I didn’t exist.

Seeing you going back to those days,
I am remembering...

The turbulence I felt,
Still wounds me.
The scars I have —
They cover my body.
They still pain me deeply.

Am I a boring person?
Or did you not care to talk to me?
Just tell me something —
So that I can move from it.

You may have something.
I have nothing.
But if you want anything,
I will get it.

Why sadness in your eyes?
You can tell me.
Why confusion?
Come to me.
Why fear?
Let me resolve it.

I don't know —
A feeling from my heart
Came to me,
Telling me your things.

I was described as "a friend."
I didn’t expect it to be.
Well, if that’s my fate,
Let it be.

Left in imagination,
Dreamed of a girl
Who loved me.

I am crying seeing her,
Aching my heart
Wherever I felt her.

What to accept,
And what not to?
All I want is her.

The untold feeling —
Ringing inside —
Feels like poison,
Slowly affecting.

The crying face I want to see,
The feeling I want to feel,
Me consoling you —
I will never leave.

Please forgive me.

The answer I found —
I want to cry,
Long, forever, and ever.

I don’t want to tell anyone.
I just want to continue it.

Maybe I didn’t understand your feelings.

Please...
Don’t feel like me.
Please reset my mind —
I want to swim.

Swim in a pool of clearness I see,
Not feel like drowning.

Please don’t kill the thing
I have been holding for so long.
I fell...

Long lost in thoughts,
I feel and see.
Please go to the end I see.

The misunderstanding I felt
Left me in shock.
Maybe it’s me —
Who never understand her feeling.

Imagined a day you left me.
Imagined a day you misunderstood me.
I would leave in anger, I feel.

Left in all conversations I involved in —
It’s the dead end for me.
Always lost in thoughts —
I will never overcome it.

You wore a dress, black and blue —
Now divided into two:
One side dark,
One side blue,
With the colors reflected towards me,
Far from you.

Deep in the abyss, I feel —
Maybe it's a place
I don’t ever want to pass through.

Things I said —
Are only limited to me,
As I will not share them through.

Things I heard and saw —
Many things are different
Than I expected them to be.

Its me changing for you,
Are u feeling it?
