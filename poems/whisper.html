Hey God, the child called you
On her deathbed.
She seemed to hear you.
She was burning, her body
Turning into ashes,
But her spirit was still there,
She was still there.

Until the last moment,
When her brother fed her
The food she never had—
she remembered you.

A life so unfair, just burning.
A life without peace.
Bones showing through skin...
I cry out the memory of her.

The people are burning.
Let me carry the memory, the suffering.
Her spirit started to fade away—
I listen to the voice calling.

The food I fed her—she said it was yummy.
Water flowed down my face.
But I wasn't crying. That face, that peace...
My thoughts—all fading.

In a direction I never saw.
Please wait for me, sister.
A princess—let me cry on your behalf.

Why leave me? I'm still here.
I'm sitting on the grave with fireflies.
They started to burn me.

I'm digging the grave next to you,
remembering when I held you.
The cold corpse telling me to let go...
But I keep holding on—

Until I hear a word,
A soft whisper in my ear:
"Thank you for everything, my dear brother."

I broke down in tears.
