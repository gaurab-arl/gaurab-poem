The touching was the thing you hated,
But came close to touch—
Feels like an iceberg,
I never expected to budge.

The emotion you showed was only curiosity
For a certain period.
That may be lost...
The time spent—
Was that worth?

Feels like forcing to talk,
Feels like forcing to show emotion,
Feels like forcing to be happy.
Never expected it to be like this—
Blocked like an iron wall
I’ve never crossed in my life.

I saw you like an angel.
Is it makeup, or natural?
If I describe myself to you—
I'm like the moon’s craters,

Filled with holes,
Never so young,
Burning with passion inside.

I take light from others.
You made yourself—
Shine like a diamond,
Reach the sky.
I'm dark like dynamite.

You distanced yourself from others,
Knowing something
I searched for.
You disappeared—like a person
I never even knew.

The blue dress was like a clear sky,
With the sun as your face—so beautiful.
Night felt longest when I didn’t see you,
Felt like an asteroid far away from the moon,
Where I couldn’t see you.

Isolated in a place
I don’t know—only God knows.
Moving like an angel
In a place called home.
You may not know me,
But I was the one thrown.

The faces I see in you
Fade me away and hit hard.
The way you changed—
I can’t recognize.
Feels like an angel
Descended from the sky.

A day filled with fear—
So much that I couldn’t hear.
A day drawn toward your care.
A day when we didn’t share a word.
A sorrow so undeniable—
Feels like an endless night,
Without a single tear.

Being accepted—
Was what I expected from you.
Never expected to be thrown by you.

A person who forgives everything
Is one who knows the weight of their sins.
You disappeared like I never existed,
Talked like I never talked,
Felt like I never felt,
Seen like I would never be seen again.

Given something unimaginable,
Taken something unimaginable.
Feels like severance.
The pain felt so bitter—
I ended up in tears.

Remember me for the things I’ve done,
Remember me for the things I suffered,
Remember me for the things I offered.
The version of me that never existed—
Was cleared.

Met in an accident,
Not the one I searched for.
Talked by accident,
Not desired for.
Remembered as an accident,
Not the person to remember for.

The hope filled the air—
Never sees the person.
Hiding like mice,
I can't search for.

The “improving things”—
Was only an excuse you used
To distance yourself from me.
Maybe you never felt like
Talking to me
Was like talking to wood.
Never expected to talk—
The only word you thought of
Was “block.”

You may have wanted to learn from me—
Which I can’t find.
Maybe I was disappointing
More than you thought I was.

The hope was lost
The day I was lost.
May that day never come again,
So that hope—
Never reconstructs.

That day,
I felt something I can’t tell.
The day fell so bright—
I couldn’t shine.
The night fell so dark—
I couldn’t even cry.
