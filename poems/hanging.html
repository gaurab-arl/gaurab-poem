A mother asked
to the body of her son,
hanging from the ceiling.

The son replied in silence,
a memory whispered back—
the feeling of her still thinking.

Life with you felt imaginary,
broken down into pieces
without consideration.

The childish feeling I get around you—
it feels like a rainbow in the sky,
so colorful,
and the warmth I find…
makes me wish I could die.

Lost in sight,
never to be found.
Left behind,
only to hide.
Looked from afar,
never seen again.
Maybe you didn't care.

Letting go—
was it the right choice?
I never knew.
Was that you,
lost in thought?

Lost in thought,

I’d never find.
Lost from sight,
I’d never find.
Is that how you say goodbye?

The shock I felt,
the happiness I held,
the sadness that remained—
was that the day
I cried?

Going somewhere I couldn’t find,
Having lost my sight ,
I was never right.
I looked back again,
but never saw the same place.
You left me behind
with someone who wasn’t in sight.

Ask a child to see you and me—
what would they think?
Whose child do you think it is?
…Never mind.

I found out something
I never told.
What can I say?
I was never misunderstood—
only left.

When I look outside the window,
is that the bird I raised
flying high in the sky?
Now,
leaving me.

I got closer to the truth,
and you proved me right.
Never in a million years
would you be mine.
“Mine” is just a word—

I don’t know its meaning,
and I don’t wish to find it.
I see a child by your side,
one who doesn't see me in light.
It's alright.

I didn’t know
what that child thought of me
until days ago--
I found out.

These are the things I don't want to think about,
but it’s alright.
The child I saw in sight…
was a little dumb, I thought.

Giving me a side-eye,
with disbelief—
liked at me ,
like an insect,
waiting to be vaporized.

I don’t want to think anymore,
because the more I think,
the closer I get.

Finding something out—
was a mistake.
Searching for something—
a regret.

Lost in the list of people I found,
realizing—
I was never on it.
Maybe I was just a temporary guest,
never let in.

Lost in a world I found
so interesting…
as I continue sinking.

Maybe you saw
another version of me—
the one who doesn’t want you
in this life.
Oh dear, I find…

Things became like a storm—
you never know when it hits.
Maybe,
by your side,
I’d feel safe.

Or maybe it’s you—
the storm I fear in sight.
But the feeling I get from you…
does it mean I’m right?

Losing you
was losing sight.
The more mysterious you became,
the more my guess proved right.

Maybe it was good
to let you go.
Oh dear, I find…

I still see you
in my sight.
Maybe it’s you—
the one who never
see me in light.
