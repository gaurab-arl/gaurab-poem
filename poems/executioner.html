        <div class="poem-content">

In a world of fairies, I liked a devil,
The enchantress she was, she attracts me.
Was that succubus, or was incubus in me?
Everything drenched in the blood.

Dryness everywhere in life,
She stopped the rain, greenery died.
Fighting for peace like a soldier,
Martyred with a garland of skulls of me.

The way lovers do— 
I wanna die-- from suffering.
That pain made me lose, the soul of God,
Drowned in fire without any water.

On a cold day when flames are flaming,
I sit beside you, hoping to burn.
Outside, I burn; inside, I’m frozen—
A neutral heart where everything begun.
