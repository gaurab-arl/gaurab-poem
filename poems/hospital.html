The hospital ,I visited 
Filled with many insects 
Looks like people’s
Like ants swarming everywhere.

I saw so much.
Watched quietly.
Different people,
With different wounds,
Each story held in silence.

Short-lived beauty never moved me.
The pain I suffer
Unspoken, unbearable—
Cannot be tolerated much longer.

Old seems fine 
Just last moment remains
Young seems to be devastated 
By their negligence. 

Just a small thing,
just a spark—
becomes a fire
we never expected.

Now we try to fix , 
Something
With only last breath remains.

Like ants looking for food,
People look into others,
Searching for answers.

Maybe they have felt relieved
After seeing other conditions.

What are we waiting for?
A cure?
If it can’t be found,
then some would rather burn it all.

I never told anyone 
Expect me,
What the pain I am 
Suffering.

I don’t want to say it aloud.
I think it's regret—
This shadow is feeling.

Pain has never felt
so real,
so sharp.
I never want to feel it
again.

I just wanted sleep.
But I knew
my time was coming—
quietly, without warning.

I never prepared.
Only hid the truth,
so I wouldn’t seem
so weak.

A bird has two wings.
I am one—
infected,
sick.

The other still flies,
but the sickness
is spreading.
We just don’t see it.

This situation is terrible.
I fear what lies ahead,
The consequences 
We yet to face.

The hospital is like a game—
We move with worry,
No map,
No menu,
Just NPCs commanding,
And we, the players,
Follow blindly.

What do I say now?
I am not a doctor.
I am a patient—
Unaware
That pain erased
My motivation.

I’ve seen people—
So many.
Each with their own burdens,
None lighter than mine.

Some cry,
Some faint.
It is a haunting beauty
This hospital makes.

Patients come and go—
a daily rhythm.
But the suffering?

Not chronic disease—
it’s the negligence
they feed themselves

Always dreaming 
Impossible things,
Like me fly 
In sky,
Fall with greater hight,

Then dies.
