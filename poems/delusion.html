Delusion I see,
But others feel.
Talked to a guy I met,
Don’t know how funny things were,
But I enjoyed and learned from him.

A family of three I saw—
Mother, father, child.
Yet I’m still finding me.

These are theoretical things,
Expressed by people around me,
Except me.

Husband and wife, but child different.
“Your husband said to me,”
I didn’t understand you then—
Now I see.

Didn’t expect the things
My friend said to me.
I don’t wish it to be me.

A friend asked another friend,
“Want a wife?”
He named a girl I know.
I looked at him.

His answer was unexpected,
Least expected by me.
What can I say?
Words escape me.

It’s the same story again,
A husband once told me.

An interesting tale unfolds—
I shared it with a friend.

He asked a girl for a kiss,
She said yes, you see.
But no action followed—
He was scared to commit.
I feel.

I asked another friend beside me,
“Would you try it?”
He said no,
Didn’t want a small thing to be,
Didn’t want it.

A very dark reality. 
A festival came, his friend, you see,
Talked to  girls a month before.
For a time, 
It was a conspiracy

Like a water pouring in sand
Then they vanished,
Like never seen.

It was a normal things,
Every time happening.
But how the girls fell?
The girls saw it as normal, but I didn’t

I asked him, “Do you have experience?”
About a love
He shared a bitter story,
I didn’t want to share it.

Then I Listened and realized—
how a child was lost
Due to people’s fearing something.

I fell from the sky,
Didn’t expect that side to be.
Now everything is haunting.

A group of people traveling together,
The reality I see.
“How many are you with?”
A girl asked a friend beside me.

“Don’t misunderstand,”
A girl said to another friend I was with.
It was just a question.
All seems to be joking,

Question were answered with embarrassment by all
Expect me
Now it was a girl turn to answer it
She answered,
“Two aside from one, I see.”

Jumping from the building—
Is that what I feel?
Please leave me alone for a bit.
