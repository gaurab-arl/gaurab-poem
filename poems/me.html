Good or bad, I can't say
How to live the best way?

Lost in thoughts,
Didn't talk —
Feels like a hard rock.

Don't know what to feel or not,
What I am thinking isn't about a girl —
It's about my own thoughts.

Looked, observed different things,
Things different than today.

Don't know how much we've changed —
The distance between people widened,
The gap is filled with greed.

Now I can't sleep,
Always thinking about my end.

I try to be a good friend,
Always ready to help —
But that's all a dream.
Even I don't trust me —
How will others feel?

The bet and promise I made,
Now all is in void.
The lost world,
The dream
I searched for.

I seem to be unworthy of all.
Not easy to trust.
Just spend time with me —
I will burst.

The burst of feeling,
The emotion I feel,
The care I am feeling.

What’s to say to boys
Who don’t know themselves —
Lost in the world
They built for them?

The difference in me and you all
Is like heaven and earth.
How to mix with you,
If I am oil
And you are water?

What’s to say to girls
Who hide the pain
Behind the mask
They wear?

Can’t share with others —
Is it fear or lack of trust
I feel?

Maybe that’s
Me —
Incomplete.

The wall I built,
Not easy to overcome.
The boring person
As I am —
Just leaving
Is the option.
