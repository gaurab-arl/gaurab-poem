Dear me,
you died while finding me —
the day
I lost hope in everything.

What were you expecting?
And
why are you disappearing?
Did you not get anything?

What's the disease I am suffering?
Please fill me with the hope you feel.

Things are not going my way,
I am diverting.
I don't feel any difficulties in the road I am walking,
because I don't see the end.

I am very much lacking,
don't know what's fulfilling.

I missed the bus
I was watching.

It was a bus meant for me—
but it closed the door before I could reach it.

Watching it leaving me,
something cracked inside me.

Was there something precious
something priceless
that I was leaving behind?

A gem.

It looked like a girl to me—
beautiful like no other,
except for the woman who raised me.

I liked you very much,
I accepted your bad habits.
Now you just have to know me,
then we will be together for eternity.

Feeling hard to feel,
seeing hard to see,
wanting hard to get —
that’s how I describe it.

I am here for you,
but
are you there for me?

You might say, "I am here,"
but where are you?
I am searching.

Maybe I will die once more
while finding.
I am lost to the world
you are living in.

Tell me about your special person —
you left while talking to me.
Happiness I see in your face
while looking and thinking about him.

I feel jealousy —
how lucky is he,
able to get you.
How unlucky is me,
not able to see you?

and once you fell lacking
please come to me 
I will hold you forever 
even u forget about me 

I will still be there,
loving you —
quietly,
silently.
