Every time I think
how a boy is different from a girl,
I wonder—
what’s the difference in thinking?
How can I get to those feelings?
Where do I search
if I don’t even have a clue?

Two girls talked,
one in front of the mirror,
and I was just a listener—
far from their place,
where they couldn’t see me.

They talked about a boy—
maybe thinking about me.
Or maybe that's just the delusion in me.

What can I say about it?
It was just a normal talk,
like how boys would talk.
But with every word,
someone’s dream
silently shattered.

Is what you said the truth?
You’re so jealous of things
when someone speaks to you—
then turns away.

Haha…
What could I say?
Words left me
in a precious moment.
Confusion embraced me.

What can I expect from others
if I got a different version of you
from someone else?

Your fear—
it let me console you.
But why give life
for something you call nonsense
if I already gave you mine?

What were you thinking,
like an innocent child
I never saw before?
Why are you so open
to your mirror self?

All your secrets—
known.
Nothing hidden.
Is that the key
to a real relationship?

I never knew you lived alone.
The responsibility you carry
is greater than mine.
But I realized it
far too late
to follow.

Watching from a distance—
that’s all I ever had.
I was never worthy.
Just realized something crucial
only a day ago.

The qualities you spoke of—
it left me in trouble.
Why even look at requirements
if I was never qualified
to begin with?

The wrong things said—
they may be true.
But not everyone
thinks like you.

Well, well—
as expected from you.
You never disappoint me.
It’s just that
the disappointment
was always me.

The other version of you—
the one in the mirror—
she’s so different from you.
What’s together or single
if there’s present love?

We can’t live in distance,
I see that now.
Haha…
Just tell me—
I’ll buy a castle 
It will be a gift.

Ten minutes
feels like centuries.
I’m growing old,
just like you.
But where will home be
if we disappear from each other,
never willing to move together?

I never knew
family requirements
mattered in searching.
Seems I wasn’t even qualified
to apply.

The thought of
never marrying,
never having a child—
it’s the same for me.
Two sides of the same coin
with different personalities.

You talk of marriage,
yet one of you is child,
and the other is older than real thing.

but you see a brother in me.
Is that why
you never liked me?

The boy you were talking about—
why does it feel
like it’s me?
Haha…
Just tell me.
Because when I think deeply,
I know—
it surely isn’t.

What was the talk
you had with your reflection?

The mirror-you
hated physical touch…
yet I touched it.
So is the poison growing in you
meant for me?

The you I see
loves it.
What do I say now?
You left me
in thought—
so deeply.

The softening words
the mirror-you spoke,
said to live in comfort,
while you told me.

When I think of you,
I think of the boyfriend
you once left to see.

The frustration—
the other voices
you talked to
and will continue to talk to—
leaves me feeling
betrayed.

The life of a boy—
it’s not so easy, you see.
We try to help,
but expect nothing.
Still—
the pain lingers.

I helped out,
but no one appreciated it.
Why did I help?
For the feeling of happiness?

Helping others
and wanting help in return
are very different feelings.

We gave up our peace
so you could live comfortably,
while we already sat
with betrayal in our hearts.

The last seat—
me and my friend—
I see still.
You were outside,
Of me.

and we were
lost in something.

The worry your beloved felt
when you left—
it was the same as mine.
I already knew…
but I never tried
to improve.

You see boys
as dirt.
Maybe you think
I’m the same.
But that’s
a misunderstanding.

I think good of you.

As a god,
I would serve—
if you'd bless me
with your feelings.

My mind is corrupted
with overthinking
and expectating.

Now I think
you overthink too.
Maybe I seemed
like I didn’t care,
didn’t want to be involved.

But trust me—
just say a word,
and I’ll appear
right in front of the mirror
you talk to.

If you want anything—
just tell me.
I’m here
to help you
in need.

But maybe,
I’m not even a friend
you’d consider.

Just a random person
who shows up
when you are at peace.
