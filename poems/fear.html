Fear
Inside us
Made us feel
Dead.

The funny things to remember
Are no where to be found

The moments we spent
Feels like memory loss.
The peace we once loved
Is fading.

The symbol of our existence
Is decreasing.

The friend I never could be
In this lifetime —
Was it a pure dream.

But
I send your way
My undying will.

Three reasons as a person
Still keep us existing.
But the problems
We once solved
Are increasing.

In science, some problem
Is never
Solved —
And neither will mine

I even dont think 
It will be

My existence
Faces a question seeing you
I am lacking very much 
After meeting you

The fear we face
Is just a wall
We have to overcome.

Fear, panic, other things —
Disappear
With a hug.

The cold stare we dream of
Others giving us —
Is the fear
We’ve built inside.
I feel it.

Someone to share
A burden with —
That is love.
That is friendship.
That is what every bond means.

A special person in life —
We all need one.

The redness we feel —
A warm feeling.
The pain burning.
The coldness we get.

The death we feel
The undead thing
We seems.
