Flying high in the sky,
Floating,
Looking at you from the cloudy side.

It rained on me—
The feeling of being seen,
From the beginning, you noticed me.

I seem to disappear from time to time,
Yet you were searching.

You seemed like an angry bird,
White and red in smile—
A playful girl,
Always wanting to be different
From the regular crowd.

A story of
Husband, wife, and daughter,
Sitting together
Beside me.
I was listening
To their feelings.

A happy couple 
Travelling,
I was just a guy waiting.

A round circle—
I’ve been walking.
What’s the end?
It seems like
The start, where I began walking.

Well, thanks
For clearing my mind.
I misunderstood
All things.

Once rejected can also be
Accepted 
Well tell me is it  
My overthinking 
Or lets paly truth and dare.

A love story 
Started when I was away
The time you spend together
Tell me some of them.

A sentence you always said—
Now just kept it 
Safe in your place.

I was just in sky
You were traveling 
I was thinking 
You were loving.
