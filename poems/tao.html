Bright and Dark path————

A disturbing sight 
Created waves unknown.
When they struck something emotionless,
A spark ignited,
And fire came to life.

Something hidden from all —
Then I came to see.
At first unsure,
Maybe I just never noticed.
But slowly, the veil was removed.
My eyes lit up — And I realized:
It was a beautiful story.

It held a word
Not found in my dictionary.
A path familiar,
But never quite aligned.
I kept seeking that spark,
Longing to see
What always struck me —
Without knowing why.

Someone looked around…
Saw something no one else tried to.
A shadow by side —
Like the Tao.
One side was bright,
The other, dark within.
What bound them?
Not love —
But the hum of bees.

A binding light between two souls,
Two crescent moons combined
To form a full one.
Yet still — a hole in the middle.
And to fulfill it…

It needs a child —
Carrying new life.
