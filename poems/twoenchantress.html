        <div class="poem-content">

Two demons — one white, the other black as haze,
Eyes like abyss, staring deep into my maze.
One seemed holy, with a complex, tempting grace,
I was a slave beneath their burning gaze.

Sweet as honey, bitter as poison,
What I drank gave unbearable pain.
Two sides of a cursed coin - one gave hope,
The other was death, no escape.

I kept walking, still under their stare,
Like flickering lights, they vanished into air.
Playful as children, mature as queens,
Their interest flickered — water rippling in streams.

I was just an expense in their cruel game,
Use me , then throw me away.
