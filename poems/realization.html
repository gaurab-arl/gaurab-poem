This is not a poem.
I’m writing this as a realization—something I found during this 2–3 week journey of writing poems.

So first, I want to thank you—for reading. You may skip this if you'd like.

And thank you to the girl I’ve been writing about—
for existing.
For being a part of my learning, writing, and understanding.
Some things may have been imaginary, but some of it was real.

In this process, I found answers to questions.
Maybe incomplete—
But I found something:

Why do we chase?
Why do we expect?
Why do we like someone?
Why do we suffer?
Why do we think we differ from others?
Why do things change so quickly that we can't adapt?

How are relationships formed?
How do we change our perspective?
How do we write?
How do emotions flow?
How do we heal?

Why do people change so quickly?
Why do we want to change?
Why does friendship change?
Why does a girl affect us ?
Why do unspoken things blur the truth?
Why do we think something is beautiful?

Why do we show off?
How can we read a mind (guessing)?
How does liking someone begin?
Why are things so different from the way they were at first?
Why do we see a person and feel their happiness or sadness?

How lively are the things around us?
Why are you separated?
How do you overcome begin traped?

Why girl hide their text messages or communication apps?
How girls feels?
Why do they stop talking?
Why do they feel insecure among others?
How thinking differ among us?

How a mask is formed?
How do a change occur?
Why is silent peacefull?
Why are you trying to distance from others?
Why are you thinking to be alone?

Why do a things dont intrest anymore?
Whats slow process?

Well if you are able to find these answer , then goodluck 
You will know something or just read books (simple , but expericence matter (maybe)) .
Again 
This is all thinking of me , people's thinking differ .
Dont try to find fault in me , I have many. 

Thank You..............smile emoji
