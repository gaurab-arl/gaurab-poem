Dead—a beautiful word I hear when you talk.
Dead—a thing I feel when I see you.
Dead—a place you left behind.
            
"DEAD"—does it mean to actually die?
Or is it a process of detaching from ourselves?
Is it just a phase of life?
A beauty in the form of a devil we all know.
A beautiful word with a painfully realistic meaning.
A pure form—sometimes even more real than life.
            
It has many shapes, many meanings,
as we continue to define it through pain, silence, and absence.
Does someone really have to die to be considered "dead"?
Is it really some imaginary world with no pain or suffering,
only ending in happiness?
            
I don’t think so.

Do we truly know the meaning of "DEAD"?
            
Many people confuse dead and death—
but no, they are not the same.
Can’t a person be dead from the inside—
with no goal, no hope—only futility, pain, and silent suffering?
Does being dead inside mean having no purpose?
No clear path? No idea what direction life is going?
            
Well,
I don’t know.
Maybe someone does. But who?
            
How many of us are dead?
Many?
Some?
All?
None?
Haha…
            
The meaning of life… is that what death gives us?
            
How many pass through it?
How many live?
How many survive?
How many just stay?
            
But what is dead?
            
Is it the zombie thing we see in movies?
Is it the lifeless form in cartoons?
Or is it something deeper?
            
Suppose someone is living life with no goal…
Is that me?
Who knows.
            
Maybe having a goal—or a person,
a girl , a family—can heal you.
But how do we heal our loneliness?
            
What are we really suffering from?
            
A disease?
Or something worse…?
