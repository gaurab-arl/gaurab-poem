A whisper, silently floating through me,
Untold, unheard — for others to see.
Observer — that's what I was in that space,
Like nobody could feel me or see my face.

A jade-like beauty, without her own light,
She shine with others — different in the night.
A heretic in brightness,
Alone in a cold, dark silence.

A bird she was — butchered by right,
A pool of blood, a knife in sight.
She tried to fly, precious wings torn —
A cold stare, a bloody night — a lipstick of light.

A drop of rain — the singularity of me.
One second I saw... the next, I ceased to be.
A god's dream, unable to escape the pain,
Letting go of the world
I had created — just for me.
