O Friend,

I failed to see it —
Always showing different things,
I couldn't tell anything.

You look like a selfish person,
Wanting to keep everything
But giving nothing back.

You changed
Because you told me something...
Were you disturbed
Because I acted like I didn't listen?

The girl you loved
Didn't give anything in return —
Now, I talk to her.
Are you jealous?

Now things have gone
North and south.
Now you doubt me,
And try to probe me.

But that's too bad —
I learned those things
When you were still playing.

The hope you gave me...
I am still thinking:
How we got there,
Where I was never meant to be.

Is that jealousy and anger
You are feeling?

Trying different things
You were not supposed to —
Is that the likeness
That she had seen in me?

Still thinking —
Why did we get stuck
On something
That only poisons us slowly?

Wanting to test me —
It's not easy.
Trying to break things
Even before starting them.

I am still thinking:
Why not wanting to see me?
Or help me?
Is that because of jealousy?

Is it because of her?
Or am I improving?

Why have you become rude to me?
Wasn't the previous breakup
A lesson for you?

Or is that excitement you feel —
That if you can't have something,
I shouldn't have it either?

Why disturb her
While talking to me?
Why act weirdly?
Is it attention you seek?

I hear bad words
About the dear one I found —
Where were you at that time?

You were given
A special position —
Before me.
Why is she always on your side?

I think...
She has already found
Her special person,
While I was nothing more
Than a temporary friend.

Lost in thought —
Maybe thinking about her —
Why try for something
That already belongs to someone else?

Even if you approach her,
Leave it —
She is different.

My friend,
Let me tell you:
The girl you are seeing
Has another "me" in her heart.

How lucky for me —
It is the same feeling,
But not actually me.
