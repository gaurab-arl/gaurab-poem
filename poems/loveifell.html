O love I feel—

I failed to feel,
Failed to accept it.
Was it something possible for me to feel?

The wishes you had,
Please tell me about them.
I may not be able to fulfill all of them,
But I will try — I will be able to do it.

Please forgive me,
The anger I got
Nearly destroyed me.

Please forgive me

The weakness I had in me
Is that
I attached to things very deeply.

When I shouted at you,
I felt betrayed by myself —
A lone figure on tall mountains,
Still waiting for me.

Everything is empty around you,
But filled with memories of me.
Things you have done for me —
I will never, ever forget them.

Sometimes,
The anger got me in every way possible.
Broken down into particles,
I couldn't combine it.

The anger I felt —
I couldn't do a thing.
I also wanted you to be happy,
But all the fault is on me.

I couldn't understand your feelings.
You just wanted to help me too,
Maybe you saw your dreams through me.
Please forgive me —
I couldn't look into you.

I know,
You had a rough life because of me.
Was I the biggest happiness
You ever got in your whole journey?

Please forgive me
For the dream I couldn't fulfill,
For the hope that died within me,
For the pain you have been suffering.

When I think of you,
I only respect you.
But when I think around you,
I get lost.

Lost every hope —
Loose like tears,
Flowing like a river.
Couldn't get up like I used to;
Now my leg is broken.

You are pure as the sun —
I see you in every possible way.
You always light me up
For something
I never expected.

Love, why are you growing
Even when I don't deserve it?
Please leave me —
Other than crying, I won't do anything.

I am infected by outer things —
I may never recover.

Lost in you,
Never meant to doubt that.
It's just that I didn't try enough.

The dream you dreamed of —
Please let me fulfill it.

For me,
You are in depth and debt
So deep I couldn't even imagine.

But it's also me —
Realized too late,
Sank too deeply.
I am also in it.

Let me sacrifice myself for your bright future.
Let me live in darkness,
So that —
I will always push you in the right path.
