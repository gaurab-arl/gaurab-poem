I see you,
don't know
if I know you.

Today a friend asked me a thing
I don't want to tell him.

Maybe he guessed it right,
but what's bad luck —
he faced,
I didn't tell him.

My friend said to me,
"Who was the lucky girl?"
I answered with a heavy heart,
"The lucky girl I see
is never meant to be with me."

I will just continue to see
from a far distance where she can't see me.
Maybe I will be in heaven or in hell.

The person I see
is growing old with time passing —
it's also me,
I feel.
Wrinkles — or something I love to see.

Maybe we will be together after
we complete our living will.

She has a person,
I know it too.
Maybe that's why
I don't approach you.

The missingness I feel
looking at you
blows me
into pieces.

Lost in lists
I don't see,
lost in thoughts of me
I don't think,
lost in caring for you —
you didn't feel.

The burning eyes
of others I see
speak to me,
telling me to make distance from her.

The different species,
same feeling I see,
but why does it have to be me?

If I didn't talk,
don't forget —
I didn't hug,
didn't cry.
If I didn't see,
don't search for me.

A moment of silence
is my friend.
Frustration is all I see,
anxiety is what I feel,
depression is all I get.

Deep in abyss I feel —
maybe it's a place
I don't ever want you to see.

Imagined a day you left me,
imagined a day you misunderstood me —
I will leave in anger I feel,
will be left in all conversations you involved in.
It's the dead end for me.

Always lost in thoughts,
I will never overcome it.

Now divided into two:
one side dark, and one side white,
with the color reflected toward me —
far from you.

Things I said
are only limited to me,
as I will not share with anybody.

Things I heard and see —
many things are different
than I expected them to be.

I least expected to be asked about it,
but that was all a dream,
started by a gentle wind.
Well, good morning —
it's morning.

Everything you do
turns out to be something
beautiful.
Everything I do
turns out to be something
painful.

Then I took my turn to do
the things I have done —
which were meaningful.

You know I love you.
If you jump into fire,
I will jump too
just to get you.

Then I know —
you were on the opposite side
where flowers were full grown.
I was in fire
where I stood alone.
