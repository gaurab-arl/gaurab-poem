I walked the road of many shadows—but I was the darkest of them all. Swimming through floods of thought, drowning in whispers I heard.
Some never spoke, bound by a secret agreement. Yet, all seemed to know. What’s the use of that show?
A powerful force divided. I didn’t want to tell. I didn’t want to remember. All seemed so…
A twisted web trapped —some were like mirrors, some rivers, some illusions sharp enough to turn the spine to silver. Delusions so real they breathed. A demon lurked behind an innocent face, a jealous eyes, ear watching, waiting.
Every meaning lost its taste though happy feeling.
How much to see? How much to feel? I was a sailor who had lost his way, searching for peace in a storm without end.
The rising sun set too quickly. Days blurred together, all the same—yet the Visitor was different. A definition shaped in silence, a truth that fractured by person.
In the end, we all drowned.
…But some were saved who already know the way.
