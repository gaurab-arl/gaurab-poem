Wait for Me
A flow —
Let things go.
You don’t
Have to know,
Or understand
Why everything comes,
Then goes.

Better to dodge the muddy ground
And move ahead —
But I’m in the middle of the ocean,
No end in sight,
Asking where I am,
From where I lost my sight.

Everywhere I see is calm,
Like you — a little girl,
Peaceful.
But I am the turbulence,
Suffering.

Why so sad?
It’s just me.
Let go, be free.
I only seem to make you
Feel weary of me.

So seek another me —
You the beauty,
I the beast —
A story rewritten,
Where others succeed,
But I failed it.

A small girl
In a drum of water
Feels like she’s in a pond —
Drowning, suffocating,
Ready to die.
But I came,
And saved her from that cry.

Yet,
She wanted to die.
I know — the hidden truth,
And I’m not the one
You wished to be rescued by.

A tsunami struck —
My place.
It wasn't a flood made of water,
But emotion.

I am just a drop of rain,
Falling from the sky,
While you —
You are the woods,
Absorbing my life.

I know I’m not the best —
I lack more
Than you can see.
You are the light,
The talent.
I am the shadow
You tried to bury beneath.

I hide my tears beneath the clouds,
like rainfall.
We were once together
In a garden —
Your care, my love —
You by my side,
My head in your lap.

A cold wind passed —
I held you close,
Trying to warm you,
And in your smile,
In the blush,
I found warmth.

Even the embarrassment —
I wore it
Like a blanket.
With tea,
Your hand in mine,
I felt alive.

Therapy —
A way to find you,
Hidden from the world,
Just to me.

I got lost in you,
Like a river slipping into a pond.
Just don’t leave.
Keep talking.
Even if I fade —
Wait for me.
