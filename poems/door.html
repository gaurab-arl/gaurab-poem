A door to her heart —
When I asked her to put me in,
She said it's closed.

Waiting was the only option,
Even if it ends in failure.
Maybe I will end up
Becoming like a skeleton,
Or in heaven where a fairy glows.

Hey,
A fairy from heaven —
I am growing old.
Just look at me
At your front door.

A door towards your heart,
Where I can't go.
The restrictions you made —
Is it temporary or permanent?
Or will we see as time goes?

Waiting for the door to open
Again,
When you closed .

Maybe you will not
Recognize me after 5–10 years old.

I think the story will be
The only thing remaining
Between me and your.

The labor of waiting forever —
Is it the pain you said?
Or is it you
That I get?

Does a wound still ache from
The past
You tried to forget?
Or is it the
Fear of not being qualified for?
Or something you can't tell ?

I see you as complete,
With some parts missing —
Just searching
For repairment,
Maybe by me or someone else.

Something was lost in me —
I don't know what you stole,
But it's all right,
As it was never mine,
Its truly yours.

As I wait for you,
Will the door always be closed?

It seems I am not the person
Who exists in your dreams,
I am a seller,
Lost in sea.

You didn’t find yourself in me
As I thought.
You are lost
To a broken bridge
Where no person goes.

At the beginning or end,
Just see — maybe I am there,
Drowning in sorrow.

A feeling at the beginning —
Was it lost or suppressed
By your thoughts?

Is it due to not accepting the facts,
Or did you try to distance yourself from them?

A heart seems heavy
With heavy thoughts.
Even if something was lost,
It's time for new things to come.

As I try to understand,
Please be open.
Even if it’s closed,
I will continue to search.

Maybe it will end up
Being my experience,
Or achieving my goal.

Even if it’s something —
Why suppress it?
Let it come.

Maybe not this time,
But after some time —
Let it be a storm.
Just take me with you
When you come.
