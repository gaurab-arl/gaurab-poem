Pair of birds flying high in the sky
Looking down on others they see.
From first glance, they seem like friends,
But deep buried in their hearts, love sprouts.

One seems to fly, the other seems to crawl—
Helping, loving each other, a support in need.
A pure, confessing love with a loving spirit,
They seem to mingle as I see them disappearing.

All I saw was a mirror hiding the image of her—
A person with a mirror showing the actual person.
A clear picture, a pure heart, a holy water,
A soul to drink from, in endless supply.
