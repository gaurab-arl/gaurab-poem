        <div class="poem-content">
A hollow mess inside a place,
Blood sprayed — like scattered paint.
I sit beneath the falling curtain,
It covers me from all that's taint. 

A silent note hums soft and low,
A whisper of the end, I know.

I tried to flee — but it was just the wind.
Golden wings, pale skin,
A face carved from emptiness.
An angel came to sit beside me,
Crying for the life she lived.

She closed the distance, whispered slow,
Of despair she faced, of evils sown.
The truth behind the mask she wore —
A hollow soul with leaves that cover
A pit no light could restore.

"Just come — come to me," she said.
"Me the devil, and you the angel",
Both with guts spilling, blood flowing —
We sit together,
Sharing our evil deeds.
