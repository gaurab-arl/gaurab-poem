A girl I see
Looks like a women that raised me,
Have something ,
I can't tell it.

Far from a distance,
I see you.
Looking at you,
I feel happy.

You look like a fairy —
The one I always dreamed of,
The one I always felt in my heart.

Tell me —
Do you dream of me?
As a hero saving you,
Or as a child searching for you?

I see your happy family —
Truly, the dream girl I always wished for.

Can you be mine,
Even if you don’t know me?
Can you be mine,
Even if I never ask for?

The hug I imagine is empty —
Without you.
The warmth I wish for
Feels cold —
Without you.

What’s a happy moment
If I can't see you?
What’s left in me
If I don't have you?

That blue dress you wore —
Maybe thats the wife ,
I See,
Standing silently beside me.

That was a joke,
Please forget about it.

I don’t know what more to say,
But everything about you
Matches inside me.

A person longing
To be the child of the woman he loves —
Maybe that's who I am.

I have accepted it.
Now,
Maybe it’s your turn to accept me.

Obsessed with your arrival,
You changed me
Beyond recognition.

A hug is all I need.
Please,
Give me it to me.

I will be happy forever
If you just talk to me.

Lost in thoughts of you,
Still hoping —
Please accept me.

When you ask me what girl I looked,
It feels like an avalanche:
Slipping slowly...
Until I fade away.

Can you feel my emotions?
Can you hold my hand?

A face so beautiful,
Never seen a fault.
A person so imaginary,
Yet feels so real.

Is this what they call love?
Or just pure affection?
I don’t know.
It’s confusing.

I once listened to something called loved twice:
First, the attraction to beauty and scent,
Second, the understanding of habits and heart.

Which one will I define?
It’s the second.
I saw the real you —
Hidden behind the mask,
An imperfect girl,
Distancing herself from others,
Waiting for someone to see.

The heart you guarded for so long
Has loosened,
By the breeze
I sent your way,
this is a dream i see about her.

I see you —
Though you don’t know
If I even exist.

In my eyes,
In my thoughts,
It was only you.

The girl ,
I see is growing older.
So , Do I
I see wrinkles,
I see passing years,
And I still love.

Lost in dreams
That did’t exist.
Lost in thoughts
That never spoke.
Lost in caring
You never felt.

The burning eyes I see —
The unfamiliar feelings —
The unknown dreams.

The dreams I see
Whisper to me:
Is this the truth?

Unknown faces,
Unknown eyes,
I find.

You didn’t talk —
I didn’t forget,
You didn’t see —
I didn’t care 
You didn’t look happy,
I stayed silent .
Hiding the tears I never cried.

The moon feels cold.
Understand my feelings.
