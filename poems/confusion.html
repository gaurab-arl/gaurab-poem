Between the Silence and the Storm
I will choose strom 
As it is the only things
That can make me live

I am a fool,
I am a coward, 
I can't seem to see truth 
It's like a mirror
THat I can't see my own reflection on.

HAHAHA
What to say?
Words escaped
From the prison I made.

I didn’t know you
Until I searched for you.
You wanted me to understand—
But I wanted a clear word.

Like electricity,
You came and went.
You arrived when I was unprepared,
Left when I was ready—spent.

A retard person, I am,
You seem like Einstein—
Still, why so confused
By my arrival in time?

How much should I say?
How much I wrote—
Yet you didn’t seem
To understand me, even a note.

You are very lovely,
Just replying
So that others
Don’t feel uneasy—maybe lying?

It seems like a hurricane,
Comes and goes as it pleases.
I waited for it
Without knowing what it teases.

Some things you didn’t say,
I knew by wind whispers.
All seemed to know you—
Except for me, the drifter.

A specific environment you lived,
I was the outsider to it.
Though all seemed to calling me
With sweet words like honey—
It was sweet poison
I kept swallowing.

Didn’t know how far you had gone,
Progress made,
Without telling me,
Now I wonder—what’s the setback,
If someone can get,
What's lost eventually?

A wind whispers
You didn’t deny.
By my side,
I listened to all the stories
Someone recites.

Haha—
Is it ignorance?
Or something true?
I can’t find the clue.

A boyfriend or friend—
I kept thinking.
But it’s the first one, right?
That’s what keeps sinking.

I thought maybe it would be me,
But I was wrong.
You just helped me
From drowning in that sea.

Well that's the lie ,
I was never in the sea,
I was just at the point 
Where sea bottom ends.

Even if it's true or false,
All I have is to wait—
Maybe months, maybe years,
But I will remember the weight.
I will wait for you,

Have I got any memory—
or just a symbol of our … fate?

In this journey,
I’ll find myself
And others’ inner sides.
Improving, learning, rising—
So that you won’t see me fall.

I will go like the winds,
But fall like the river—
Deep, strong,
Forever a giver.

Until I have fully known,
Or grown
HAHA 
What to maybe I am just too old.
