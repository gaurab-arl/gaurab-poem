Ke garau ra kasari, ma harau ni jasto chhu, aba na harau ni jasto gari. 

Now there's nothing left — I'll leave silently.
No one should wait for me.

Awh...
It hurts to see,
It hurts to feel,
There’s a danger coming for me,
But now, I can’t even see it.

Maybe it’s time for me to fall apart,
Broken into pieces,
By the things I heard
Whispered in the wind.

Now,
I think it’s time for me
To face the inner me.
