A Girl and a Boy
What will begin
If I am an empty shell?

A fairy came from Heaven
To see me.
The feeling of emptiness fades away
With you, with me.

The conclusion
In the end was a losing game.
If I am lost,
Will you console me?

The empty shell
I am.
Please fulfill me —
The emptiness —
With love you feel.

What's the end of empty?
I don't know.
Maybe a death I see.

Let's go far away
From this place,
Me and you
To the spiritual place.

A beauty with a beautiful face,
Me as a monkey,
You as an Eve.

A boy wanted to flirt
With a fairy
From fairy tales.

A fairy
Didn't deny it —
Maybe she was enjoying.

The false claim
She didn't deny.
Maybe something else
Was hidden inside.

The world is in fire,
With me burning
As medium.

A fairy sees it
From far away —
Just looking and asking,
Not showing emotion,
Just a general curiosity.

I feel dead, looking at you with me
And looking at you with another — happy.
I said to me,
"Why can't it be me?"

I tried to improve
But something fails me.
I don't know what it is
Until you tell me.

Someone’s dream came true
While searching.
A girl, looking from the window,
Felt
A neck pain.
Boy was with
A broken heart —
With a broken face.

When will
The game end?
And
When will you stop
Disturbing me?
Just leave me a space —

A space of emptiness.
Wait and come
When I fade away.
