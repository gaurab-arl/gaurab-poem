My Beloved Bride
Promise me—you won’t cry.

The space between us
exists only in the mind.
Even when we’re together,
we are farther
than where eyes can find.

Your crying face—
I can’t fight.
I only saw you happy
when things went right,
when the world bent softly
to your light.

Ah,
my lovable bride,
I can’t just say you’re my pride—
you are everything,
even though
I have nothing left to sacrifice.

The moon is beautiful,
the night is long.
Our pure feelings,
our fate—
are bound by us,
silent but strong.

Even if we can't stay together,
just for a moment—
let me hold your hand.
Your soft cheeks—
let me kiss them.

Your lovable eyes—
let me dive in,
until the last
moment—
let me cry.

Even as a ghost,
let me feel you.
Even if I die,
let me remember you.
