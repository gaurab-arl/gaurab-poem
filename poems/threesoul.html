A Garden for Ghosts

A small world
With only
Two girls sitting on
Garden of rose

Two pure soul
One gold
Other seem white—
Snow with dark spots.

Though I seem to be by their side
I am but A dead soul

A league of their own
I seem to have a degree
Of overdose

A medicine
Regularly I take
Make me feel okay
But in reality
It damages more than a girl's kiss

A hunt has begun
I am fleeing
Far from sights of eagle
That seem to look for me

A fair play does not seem to exist
I am new player in it
With old begin pro
I die with more than
A highest scored

A powerful enchantress
Two soul exhibit
That seem to pull
Me with
A powerful force

That seems to
Attract me more than i control

A dead soul
That you seem tried revive
Has lost all hope

The soul of enchantress
That seems to look for me
Has given me hope
But keeps taking it back

I am but a bastard though
Lost to tears
Bringing back hope
I am scattered soul

In the story of bee and flower
I am a traveller
That just walked through bees
Looking at a flower with another

In a garden of flower
You seem a little different
Always dueling in thought
But i know
Who caught your falling

I am a wind that you traveled with
And a ghost,
You saw in your dream
