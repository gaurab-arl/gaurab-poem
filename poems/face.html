When I Look At
My Face
I Look Like An Ape

Lost From An Era
Where Dinosaurs Lived
They Died Tragically
But Something Let Me Live

I Looked Like A Failed Product
From A Double Mistake

A Bit Too Old
For Love
Like A Sunset
Going Down
From The Sky
Never Will Be The Same

I’m A Moth
Drawn To Flame—
Was I Dumb?
I Jumped Into The Burning Flame
Just The Same

Flame Around Me—
How Beautiful Was The Scene
I Couldn’t Resist—
Like Midnight
Lit By Fireflies
In Moonbeam's Gleam

I Never Saw My Face
Thinking I Was Okay
But Ha—
What A Delusion
I Lived That Day
I Looked Like
A Mashed-Up Cake

The Girl I Was Seeing
Was A Fairy
Never Thought
I Would Make It

Back Then I Thought
Maybe I Would Get It
But Now
I Think It’s A Place
Where A Person Goes
And Dies In Burning Flames

Now All Seems A Dream
I Have Been Dreaming
But I Wanted To Keep It

Maybe Not In This Time
I Will Get It
But In The Next Era
Where You Will Bless Me
