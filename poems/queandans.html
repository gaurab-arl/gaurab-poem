Question:

The rain, the cold drops and this bizarre wind
Will they ever return to the place they were
I already know—then why do I lie?
Lies, more lies, it's losing the sincerity at this moment.

Why? I wonder – whispering this again & again
Is it fear, fear of losing—never mind
Fear or something within
Oh dear—your bright smile
Why does it dim in my right?

Every time we cross paths
That happy eyes, fades away.
As a silent looss
A silence so loud that I can hear 1000s of words 

I know it right? right?
Deep down in the my heart, besides the covers
I know it's me right.
And hence I drowned
More, more & more I kept sinking

Oh dear, I wish I could say I hope
But how,
Uttering the words, feels like a sin
As I know I committed a crime.

Answer :

All the things can be same as before,
In the right time.

It was never a fear you felt,
Maybe it was the wrong time.
            
A person also never mind ,
Its okay to tell something ,
You find hard to describe.
            
Surprised me
When I read this.
Is this the question or the answer
I find?

Lost my words when I read this,
Maybe an answer lost in sight.
            
Never expected a lost thought to be found out—
Is that the thing you or — ,find?

What was in your mind when you wrote?
Is that the same person I find? 
            
Has a smile been lost because of you?
Maybe it is you—sometimes a person’s smile,
Or it was a smile that kept a person bright.
            
Maybe it was .... , a person find ,
Maybe it a thing u didnt find ,
I also have right to know it right? right
            
Dont feel drowned , by a person side
As a person will pull you ,
When lost in sight.
            
Never expected such words to come from you.
I had a hard time.

Were you disappointed at first that I didn’t find?
Maybe it was… a hard time.
            
Lost in thoughts, kept in silence—
Maybe it was a magic word whispered a thousand times.

What’s the sin you spoke about?
Maybe it was a blessing coming into sight.
            
As I finish,
Ohh dear , A person find .
Wanted to ask:
What was the thing you crimed?
