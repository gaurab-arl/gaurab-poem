A girl cried after seeing
The result of sacrifice.

The redness, like a gem
In jewelry on her face,
Tells it all—
The dreams scattered
by a suprise Unkonwn to us.

A girl crying alone at night
Whispers her sorrow to the sky.

A voice returns—
Softly saying, "Don’t cry."

Like small rain,
Tears fall from her eyes,
A cloudy world reflected in their light.

Once a diamond, shining bright,
Now dulled—
By something temporary,
Taking her life.

I won’t ask why.
I already know.
But still—
My inner self wanted to ask,
"Are you all right?"

I won’t try to stop you.
If you want to cry,
Then cry.
But just for a moment—
Look through my eyes.

The sight I see—
A special soul,
Breaking beneath a weight
From past , she bore.

Seeing you like this
Aches in my sight—
But I won’t cry.

My eyes are dry.
Let me borrow your tears,
So you can see
My crying sight.

I’ll be here—
Not to wipe your tears,
But to keep them safe,
So they don’t fall
Onto the ground
That’s already soaked

Let me keep them—
For the sake of your beautiful eyes.

Look around…
You may not see me.
And yes, I won’t be.
I’m behind the dark curtain,
Hidden beneath beautiful lights,
Silently praying for you
To be all right.

Maybe I’m not on your list—
Not among the friends
But I’m still here,
Far away,
Yet close in my care.

Let it all go,
If it’s meant to be,
It will be.

And if it’s not—
Then just forget it
Like a beautiful morning dream,
That only stay when 
Our eyes are closed.

Even if you cry,
Things won’t be the same.
Let it be a chapter—
Don’t try to turn it
Into your whole story.

If you ever need anything,
Just ask.
There’s no need to be shy.

Though I say this,
I know—
You probably won’t ask.
Still,
Try sometimes.

Don’t ask for skies
Or stars I can’t give—
But I can show you
A small reflection
Of the things
That caught your 
Beautiful eye.

A beauty crying…
I won’t wipe your tears.
But I’ll try to make you smile
Between them.

So cry…
And look at me,
Smiling—
Not to mock you,
But to whisper that
Everything will be all right.

Even if you misunderstand that smile—
Don’t explain.
Just stop speaking.
I understand silence
Better than I understand myself.

This feels like too much—
My heart can’t carry more,
So for now,
Goodbye.

And still…
Let me ask one more time:
Will you be all right?

Just keep fighting.
Don’t look back.
Well…
I am just very dark.
