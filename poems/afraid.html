Hey girl, this is poem 
I’m writing about you.
I don’t know if you can feel this,
But still—
This is for you.

Don’t ask me why—
Just know that I understand.
More than I say out loud.

You may have guessed
what i feel
But lets forget about all of it
Feel my things.

Are you feeling heavy
from a weight you imagined?
Share some with me—
let me carry it.

The weight I carry is heavy—
but not like yours.
So tell me…
what dream of your?

Or are you heartbroken,
haunted by the past?
But look at my heart too—
like shattered glass,
tell me which piece doesn’t reflect you.

Maybe I shouldn’t complain,
but why do I feel lost in this?
Maybe I thought I was that guy—
the one you kept thinking...

Why are you suffering—
drowning, sinking, feeling trapped?
Are you overwhelmed
by your own emotions?
Let me try to make it right.

The emotions I feel torment me too,
but can’t you find joy just seeing me,
As I feel too.

I’m here for you—
like an umbrella in the rain,
even if I’m broken,
I’ll still shield you from the storm.

Come to me—I'll comfort you,
Cry with you,
Share your pain with me;
Let me feel it too.

Forget everything for a moment,
Be by my side—
Let’s silence the thoughts
Coming from all sides.

Don’t think your actions
Have only brought hurt;
Not everyone sees the way you do.

Why are you hiding
That innocent part of you?
Why wear a mask
So others won’t judge what’s true?

Let me look behind your mask.
I wear one too.
Let’s see each other—
Truly, fully, honestly.

Don’t be afraid.
Let me accept all of you.

The emotional disturbance you've faced—
Let me be the one to balance it,
Or let me swing with it.

Why are you guilty?
And for what?
Don’t carry it alone—
Let me be guilty for that.

Tell me about the turbulence you’ve endured,
The storm comming your way,
Let’s run away.
But please…
Don’t ask me to leave you.
Leaving you would feel like living dead.

Let me be the one
To open the door that trapped you—
Or let me in,
And we’ll face the darkness together.

I can’t help myself…
But let me help you.
The weight you carry—
Let me reduce some.

Why live in darkness
Surrounded by so many peoples?
I came to take you
To the other side—

So I can see you
In a light,
So bright,
It outshines me.

Please, don’t overthink anything.
I didn’t come to change you—
I came to fix what hurts inside of you.

Express what you want.
I’m here to listen, to see.
Tell me your story—
I’ll hear it.

The pain you feel,
Share it with me.
Let me become a part
Of the world you’re in.

Why live among thorns,
Where I see pain blooming in you?
Maybe you’ve grown used to it—
But could you bear to see me in it too?

Let me take your place.
Let me go to the garden full of roses—
So I can watch you smile,
And finally see your joy unfold.

I’ll try to understand you,
Even if you push me away.
If you think you don’t deserve love,
Then let me be the one
To deliver it anyway.

The pain behind your walls,
The truths hidden behind your mask—
Let me break through them,
So I can see you.

Show me your beautiful face—
Even if it holds scars.
Don’t hide them…
Scars are still a part of you.

I have a body full of scars—
All except the face.
Let me wear one more,
So I can complete it...

Let me travel through your past—
To heal the wounds
That still ache.

Are you afraid?
Well… I am too.
You wouldn’t accept me,
So I came without telling you.

I won’t accept you,
Not because you’re flawed,
But because I want you to be happy.

The restrictions inside me—
They bind me.
Chains of pain and suffering...
Let them end with me.

Haha…
The feeling of being trapped,
The fear of being wrong,
The sensation of drowning—

Let’s leave those behind.
Let’s walk into the world
We both still have yet to see.

The goodness I’ve found,
The passion I feel,
The ignorance I carry—
That’s just the nature I had in me.
May you transcend it.

What’s there to accept in me?
I am empty…
So let me accept you.
Fill me with your burdens—
Even your negative things.

Let’s support each other
Until the end of time.
Maybe in this journey,
We’ll discover our true selves.

The rest...
I’ll say it
When my heart is ready.

Please tell me if you have any.
