The shadow moved, but the man didn’t.
He was looking at the sky, feeling something.
A thought in his head was playing music,
Images constantly shifting and dancing.

He had completely lost the reality he was in.
Knowing or not, he walked slowly
Happiness on his face, sadness in his eyes,
Firm steps forward toward the sky.

Leaving the ground, something he loved
He lost his balance, without support.
He started falling, reaching for something to grip,
But only emotions remained…
And now, he is slain.
