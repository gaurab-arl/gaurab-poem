Sorry for the person I see.
Sorry for the people I saw fighting.
Sorry for them, the ones who raised me.
Sorry for those who trusted me.
Sorry for those who see hope in me.
Sorry for existing.

Sorry for hurting.
Sorry for touching.
Sorry for everything.

It's me, feeling sorry for all sorts of things.

Do you know what a person thinks
When they look down from a high height?
They see...

Well now, I think that person is me.
I don’t know what a person thinks.
It’s all confusing.

What do you say to someone
You wanted to be friends with?
Hiding has become a part of me.
O God, please take me

To the hell you see.
May there be only me.
Please excuse others—for me.

Wanting to be free
From all things.
I wanted to rest.
But all I’m left with is reality.

The false hope I see
Piercing to me fully,
Ending my days
Again with imagined things.

You may saw me cry
With a face I’ll never make again.
No tears falling,
Just the red face I’m feeling.

Did you ask
What's the reason for this?
Today I realized something.

The lies I was fed,
The expectations coming from me,
The things I heard—
I never expected them to be.

May it all end within me,
So nobody sees through it
Or becomes like me.

I don’t know what I’m feeling.
I think it’s guilt and regret
I’m filling with.

Repeated the same things over and over.
May that be the last day
I’m ever seen.

Felt shock
from the things I never expected
from the someone I see.

I’m asking myself
A question, maybe—
Is that me being annoying?

Awhh... please burn me alive
For the pain and annoying things
I believed—and caused it.

From now on, what do I do
If I destroyed the things
I was building?

To the future me:
I’m sorry
For destroying you
With the uselessness
I carry with me.

I don’t know anything depressing—
But I know something:
It’s killing me inside, deeply.

Saw someone’s face I hadn’t seen in months.
I had forgotten they always wished me well.
Why did it matter? 
If i forget all of it.

The things I witnessed and heard
haunt me.
Why would you say that to me?
Well , forget about it.

Why does it matter to me?
I see the moon appearing and disappearing,
the sun burning me in the day.

All of you—please forget about me.

Why do you care?
Just leave it alone for a bit.
Maybe I’ll never walk again
for the same reasoning.

I expected things from others.
I really don’t know
what was my breaking point,
I faced it.

To them I have given
false hope.
I’m really sorry.
May you have another me
with a different personality.

To those who gave hope to me—
It’s my fault
For misunderstanding.

It’s the hope for improvement, I think,
or the things that never existed.

I won’t mention any names.
If you’re reading this
And you feel this—
This is for you.
I’m writing it.

From now on,
I will never be seen.

That was my last sentence.
So, at last—
I’m very sorry for everything.

I won’t say a thing.
You know what I’m talking about.
Please, forgive me.
