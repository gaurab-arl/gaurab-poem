        <div class="poem-content">

Witty one around me, I keep,
Playful whenever she speak.
Revealing her deeper thoughts—
When she talks, she never stop.

Flirtatious in a teasing way,
Maintains control of how much she shares.
Enjoys unpredictability, smile on face,
Silly girl, she even forgets my name.

Appreciated for her sharp personality
As much as her looks—sweet as a cake.
She drifts like the restless wind,
Unable to keep or cage her in a place.
