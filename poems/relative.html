Behind the friendly smile
master of art, the master of changing—
the change of what it was previous,
now all remains is their ashes.

The faces of close person hiding a poison,
just behind the back, the wolves of pack—
can't eat, attack—just the game of words
that affect then the whole system.

Without a leader, follows own making—
was it a custom of their teaching?
An inate, inborn talent—the jealousy,
the root of tree that want to suppress it.

The lovable, the crude emotions they give—
just a thing to expect, but the definition of it?
Why do we live—just to be free?
Just to see the games of old living?

The game of source of living, making corpse—
can't share, can't give, just make it a antique.
The way of changing person like a season,
without telling, the reason: "surviving".

The one that seems to understand me—
just a feeling, the survival of jungle they made.
Just kill and eat it, the person front of me...
