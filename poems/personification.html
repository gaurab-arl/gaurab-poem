The illusion I see
Keeps distancing
Herself from me.

She tried to show herself—
But I hid her,
In a dark place
Where she shines best.
Still,
I tried to avoid her.

But she is coming for me
Again,
To be accepted,
To merge with me.

The world she tried to keep me in—
I saw it many times.
Now, it doesn’t seem real.
I saw weakness in myself
Before she ever did.

I had already fallen for her,
But she denied the fall.
I had accepted her before,
Now I deny her.

Now I fear her—
The truth she longed to show,
I no longer wish to know.

The things I never had in the real,
She brought them to me, 
In a world of illusion 
I distanced from it.

Yet she was the world
I had always lived in.

The beauty she never tried to hide
Memorized me.
The sweet words she whispered
Still echo in me.

All was part of the interest
She saw in me—
But time, like a river,
Never drowned me in.

Her interest was lost
Like the river
Flowing away from me.

As I kept my distance
She kept nearing me.
I found the world I’m part of
Was hers—
Built differently,
Just for me.

She accepted nothing from me,
Even when I wanted give.
Perhaps she feared
To break the bond between us.

The bridge made of feeling—
Now broken.
Its glass, once glowing,
Now scattered.

All I see are thorns,
Like those of roses—
They wound easily,
Yet never truly heal.

All she left
Was a scar upon me.
She never meant to leave,
Only to accept her,
Thoughtfully.

She wanted me
To live in her illusion—
A dream I’ll never dream again.

She’ll keep showing
beautiful dreams,
Like in morning
sleep,
Until I wake,
Myself from it.
