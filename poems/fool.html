The fool in me , To mirror 
I see .
The fool ,
I wanted to be.

Two fools talked to ,
One was me 
and
Another one was 
The past mirror image of me.

A fool is called a fool—
Do you think that fool is me?
Or do you see that fool within me?

There’s something that I see—
Can’t you see it ?
That man acting the fool… is me.

A curious child, I see in you,
You act like you don’t know—
Even though it feels like you do.
At least around me ,
That feeling hidden inside me.

Fooling around, playing around,
I do things carelessly,
Pretending not to care 
Everything around me.

But deep down,
It really hurting and It burning
Something inside of me.

I see a buried figure,
Red eyes.
A narrow, yet beautiful face
That keeps me thinking…

What am I to you?

Am I just a random person?
Someone special?
Or just someone who came and went
Like a stranger in road passing,
Side by you.

I see flashes from the past—
Things I want to forget…
But really can I do it?

Deep down, somewhere unknown,
It got me thinking
Was I ever necessary…
For existing?

Fooling myself to see
Fooling myself to get
Trying to understand— it
But what’s the point of doing something
If you can’t even see it?

You can call me a fool.
You can think what you want.
But fearing my own innerself—
I wonder if I even know you.

Losing myself in you,
Trying to find myself in you—
But all I see is darkness.
Maybe I don’t exist for you.

It hurts.
Really, really hurts.
Feels like you stabbed me
Right in the heart.
That lived for you.

I acted like a fool around you,
A friend,
A protector,
Like I was the only one who cared.

And now, I’m thinking again—
What am I to you?

If you’re reading this,
Do you think it’s about you?
Don’t ask me.
I won’t say I thought of you.

But the truth is—
I saw a part of myself in you.
Searching,
Every corner in you

Ask yourself:
Do you see me in you?

Seeing myself in you
Felt like searching for a pin in the desert.
I will never find it
Even i give my life for you.

Drowning myself in songs I listen to—
What’s the purpose,
If I just feel more lost
And depressed 
After thinking about you.

I see the dreams of everyone around me.
But what’s yours?
The one you’ve been hiding?

I’m searching places to find you.
For a heart to—
understand the rest of you.
For a emotion to—
Do best for you.

Like the sun and moon,
I feel you.
Lost to the earth—
The one you left too soon.

Burying every soul of peoples 
In my own graveyard
That ever reached out to you…
