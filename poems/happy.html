Happy person I see —
The childish innocence,
Wanting to help others in need.

A person with beauty and brain,
Yet the feeling of hopelessness —
She feels.

I can't resolve it.
The person who sits beside me
Is empty.

From the back I see —
The friend I made
Back then
Is leaving.

The short-term interest
Shown in me
Was a curiosity.

The dream
Of being the one
All the way to the end —
Is scattering.

The friend I wanted to be —

I was never depressed,
But I feel
Emptiness in me.

The void in the sky I see —
It reflects a mirror in me,
Always presenting
The person
Others wanted me to be.

I was never my true self,
Because
Others never tried
To see it through me.

I am the same as others,
But the difference
Is in thinking —

The person
They share their thoughts to.
But for me… it’s just me.

I wanted to other 
What I feel
But its me overthinking.

What do I say to myself?
All it says is:
“Just leave it.
You were never capable
Of doing anything.”

I wanted to cry that day.
The tears rose in my eyes,
But I stopped.

Then—
After some time,
It started to rain.

I tried many times,
But no one saw me.
How do I tell
Of the suffering I’m feeling?

I don’t know how to put
It into words I know.
Please, try to understand.
Please—
Hug me
The moment my eyes
Refuse to dry.

I tried to feel others’ pain
And talk to them…
But they felt
It was mocking.

They showed their goodwill,
They listened…
Then they left me.

A feeling
Of being lost
Grew inside me.

The person I wanted to be,
For them to see,
Feels like a curse
To me.

How to become a person?
Someone—
Please,
Teach me.
