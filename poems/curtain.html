        <div class="poem-content">
She who lives behind the curtain
Fears something she cannot name—
A hidden feeling, a poison she drinks
Again and again, in silence and shame.

A kind soul, yet she whispers nothing,
She goes when she feels,
Returns when she pleases—

Your grace—a moonlight gleam,
Free, beautiful, yet filled with turbulence.
You whisper into the void,
Parting from something you once held .

In a horde of horses, none win the race.
Shock veils every place.
I know the truth behind the painful scene—
Only one won, for that horse was already past the end.

Can't speak it, can't harm—everyone adores her.
Like a gem, yet she is a single piece
Of black coal,
Bearing a pain that flows like liquid inside.

She resides in a bloodbath of thoughts,
A soul corrupted by expectation,
And envy that drips from every eye.
Sometimes she wonders—

If she didn't exist,
Like an ant that moves unseen—
Would things be better,
Or would they remain the same?
