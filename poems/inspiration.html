Are you an inspiration — or a parasite?
Like still water, muddy and unclear.
Each time it ripples, it shifts —
What stays the same?
Do tides ever return as they were?

I relate to things that never existed.
Winds pass me by, avoiding my way.
I chase them — like a child after butterflies,
While you soar, a bird that always flies away.

A crimson moon in the sky, glowing bright.
A lonely night — I wander past midnight.
At eleven o’clock, I walk down empty roads,
And in the silence... I find something I enjoy.

Was that a cry yesterday? Or empty tears?
An emptiness shared, joy that split apart.
The one who crafted such technique —
Was someone who never received what was his:
Disillusion.

What’s left in the past —
Maybe just memory.
Or the kindness you showed,
Never whispering a word —
Only silence,Only effort…
Some things were fated —
Until someone gave away.
