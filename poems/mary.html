A Beautiful Dream Of Me

A Life With You
I Wanna Live With

All The Moments Of My Life
I Wanna Spend With You
I Wanna Die With You

Let Me Sleep On Your Lap
A Pillow For Me
It Will Be A Sweet Dream

I Dream Of You
Every Day
Even If I Sleep

I Wanna Marry You
Live With You
For Rest Of My Life

A Wife And A Husband
We Will Be Identified As

Me And You
I Will Introduce You
To My Friend
Like My Queen

That Will Rule My Kingdom
I Built For
My Queen

The Home I Made For
You Is Empty
Without A Light
Until You Accept It

The Happiest Day Of My Life
Will Be Meeting You
The Saddest Day
Will Be You Leaving Me

We Started As Classmates
Now We Are Newlywed
It's Just The Phase
I Liked To Use
Nothing Contain in me.

I Can’t Contain
The Feeling Within Me
Let Me Hug You
Like A Corpse
Hugging Each Other
Even After Death
I will fall again.

The Promise I Will Make
On My Wedding Day
Will Be The Death—

Only Death Will Separate Us
Not Even Our Friends
I Will Strangle Them To Death
If They Try To Separate

I Am Obsessed With You
Even If I Don’t try

I Can Write As A Psychopath
As Lover
As Many Characters You Want
Me To

Just Tell Me You Will
Be With Me
Until I Die For

Let me hold you, night and day,
Until my final breath fades away.

Like A Sunset
I Will Live With You
Until My Death

A Baby Between Us
Will Be Our Love
A Child Will
Be Like You

Always Shine In Any Place
Will It Be Boy Or Girl
You Guess

I Don’t Know
How To Describe My Love

I Feel
If You
Die One Day And Leave Me

I Will Murder Every Person
Living In place 
Other called it universe.
