        <div class="poem-content">
The child I became,
The person she made,
The devil I turned into—
Stil with her all care.

I pray to demons,
She prays to God.
A change began in me
As I started to fall.

The devil
Helped me descend,
But as she prayed to God,
He pitied seeing my fall.

What’s left in me?
I am lost.

The feeling of loss
Occurs in when I’m alone—
Like a breeze, like a weight,
I begin to free fall.

The room I was kept in
Is now filled with water—
I can’t see a thing.
I was never meant to drown,
But I still try to swim.

The things I ignored,
Calling them small,
Now I do them.

All of them feels like,
Flood,
Comming my way,
I seems to realize,
The pain you felt.

I now feel pressure.
The smile never left me
As I took on your work.

Now I understand
The helplessness you hid.
The pain of losing—
I feel it now.

Lost in memories,
I feel so small.
I was a fool
To not see the vast world
You were shielding me from.

What is the hope
You see in me?
Is it love?
Or a dream
You wish me to fulfill?

The child inside me
Looks out at the world—
He sees wonder in everything.
But I see boredom in it.

Now I see the adult me
Is dying slowly—
From overthinking.
The child I neglected once
Is calling me.

The small child playing beside me
Sees a girl—
The one who gave me life.
She was never young,
Yet never seemed old.

As I continue to grow,
I begin to show
The cracks you once filled—
Now they only grow.

The face I hated,
You loved so much.
You saw a world in me,
I saw only dust.

What’s the fault in me? you ask—
I am fault,
And fault is me.

What will be left of me
When I see you
Leaving?
