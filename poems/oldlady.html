The way I see her — an inspiration for living,
A story without end, an unforgettable dream.
Whenever she arrives, chaos crawls behind,
And I become her shield,
Willing to shatter just to keep her with me.

Playfully flirtatious, untamed like the wind,
Yet guarded — perhaps afraid of being seen too deeply.
She hides real feelings behind jokes and emojis,
Unique, always shifting, always surprising.

Sarcastically charming, yet personally racist,
Likely loved for her personality,
Not just her beauty — though that’s in her genetics.
It’s just her being funny — my old lady.
