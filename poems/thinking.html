Fear resides inside me
When I am thinking.
What if someone is reading
The thoughts I am thinking?

Where is the god I serve?
Where is He?
I am searching.

The god I wish to meet,
The god who forsakes me—
Where is the god I serve?
The god I thought didn’t exist?

The mask I once wore
Is cracking.
The things I was hiding
Are viewing
The one who forsook me—
Is watching.

Is it a child or a demon
That I’m hiding?

From the outside, I seem mature,
With a sharp mind.
But inside,
I’m just a child,
Lost in a dream—
The dream I have been dreaming.
