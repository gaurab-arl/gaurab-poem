I pointed a gun
in my mouth,
fearing the results
I once enjoyed.

I forget the surrounding
I found.

Since I came to this world,
I enjoyed much more than cry,
but I weight each other—
cry weighed more
than the moments I enjoyed.

All living
creatures fear pain and death,
but I saw a salvation
hidden inside it.

If you want to be free from pain,
then just die,
or just submit to Divine.
He who sees all
will provide you a guide.

Don’t abuse,
don’t kill either.
Just embrace them
like your own siblings,
just like from the same mother—
same blood flows inside.

Strive to understand,
thrive to get,
even if it means to embrace death.

Pain is the natural process,
even gods didn’t get—
it's the universal thing.
Everything is in its
own place.

The world is constantly
burning,
yet you all are covered in darkness.

See the God hidden inside,
feel peace,
just accept it.

Maybe you are not as good as many,
not as much worth as others,
but as you see the environment—
not everything is so constant,
such as us.

Why did you seek the light?
Maybe you will
find
the heaven
where I have been living inside.

A peaceful environment,
a self-satisfaction,
a real love inside.

Tall mountains with a small cottage,
living with my wife and beautiful child.
A child will be named Lily,
though she is a bit silly.

But a happy family
I created through
the Divine guideline.

Just submit to Divine—
you will be free
from the fears inside.

Even a butcher drops the knife,
he will become Buddha.

Then,
my child, you are many times intelligent
than I am.

Then just follow what you think is right.
