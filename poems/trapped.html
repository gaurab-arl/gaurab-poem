Sorry… the word I hear.
I brought flowers, dripping with my blood—
scars all over me.
The devil smiles with me,
thinking he's met someone just like him.

The mixed hints that kept me locked
in a box of beautiful dreams—
dreams of you and me.
A shattered soul, a shattered dream,
for the one I wanted to live with.

The dying son of a mother
sees a blurry sky,
eyes veiled with water.
Crystal-like gems fall—
wasted on something
that never felt like his.

An insect trapped in a spider's web…
Should he jump from there—
to another web of another spider?

The hungry faces of spiders
look at me like I'm a delicious meal,
craving me endlessly—
yet never eating.

The fear keeps growing.
I seem lost—
lost to the fear,
to the thoughts
trapped inside me.
