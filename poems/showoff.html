I now see the way you came today —
A feeling of wanting to see the girl and talk too,
But what I feel is something else.
The longing today, The desire to get.

This is where you and I differ.

The thoughts have a grip on me —
The words you said to me,
They were just funny things,
And I let them go.

Like a leaf 
Floating 
In the wind.

I left it 
For other to see
