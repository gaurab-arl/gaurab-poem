        <div class="poem-content">
The boy you talked about is my friend.
It was like a rectangle we formed—
We were the vertices,
And you, the center.

But the sad thing is,
I wasn’t in it.
I was just a random point
Outside the surface.

It seems we’re speaking in math,
Where our distance
Stretches to infinity.

Your brother—
Always joking,
Why does he seem innocent,
While I feel resentment?

The overprotectiveness,
The innocence I don’t like—
Why does he
Always distract me?

Like a bone in meat,
He’s always in the middle.
But deep down,
I know I’m not even there.

For you,
A prince is waiting.
I was just grass passing by.

May the wind blow me away,
May I be stomped,
May I be eaten—
But at least smile,
As I helped clear your path:

Cleared the mud you faced,
Cleared the obstacles ahead.
I don’t know where I am now,
Blown by your gentle wind.

The past I remembered—
The past where you existed—
Is now the present,
Where even a small talk
Feels impossible.

Were you
Thinking of me?
The incident I caused—
Did it wound you deeply
As confusion grew?

Like a growing bamboo,
I rose slowly.
But the final day
Was my fatal blow.

What were you expecting?
Did the burst of feelings
Overwhelm you?

Now,
The distance has grown.
The journey is turning
Silent.

This silence is killing me.
Let me transcend it—
Or leave me.

I didn’t find the answer
I was looking for.
I didn’t see the reaction
I was hoping for.

But that’s okay.
I’ll take it as rejection—
Impossible to be together.

Seeing the building in front of me,
I see two figures sitting.
The talk you shared with your friend—
I listened closely.

Who was it?
I kept wondering.

The boy left me
In a dilemma
I may never overcome.

Your friend described your husband
As a bus driver.

Did I witness the moment
You picked up something
You once left behind?
Haha—what more is left to see?

If that boy isn’t me,
The messages you talked about
Were never meant for me.

Who was the lucky one?
I kept thinking.

A lone person walks
Down an empty road—
Sees a zombie—
Shoots it.

How should I describe it?
I am that person—
The one you left behind
To choose someone else.

The boy you're talking about—
Jealousy grows in me,
But I stay composed,
Still watching quietly.

This feeling of fear
Grows inside me.

From now on,
I’ll continue to see and feel—
As if you
Never existed.
