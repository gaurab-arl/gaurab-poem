Once I left,
Then came back once again.
The feeling I left behind —
I don't wanna see.

Now as I know,
And others see,
They ask about me...
But —
I didn’t say a thing.

I
Passed it to the next person I see.
But —
Now it’s my turn again,
And I still won't say a thing.

The truth inside,
I had scraped it out.
Now I see —
Pain whispers to me:
“Do you want to be lonely?”

The feeling of being left out
Keeps growing inside me,
Drowning in a pool
Of wild imagination.

The song I listened to was depressing,
Forcing me
To think too much about myself.

The loneliness I felt,
Told me to vanish,
Quietly,
Without saying anything.

Lost in thoughts all night,
I can’t sleep.
But it’s you I’m thankful for —
For everything.
I felt happy.

Putting the loneliness aside,
You gave me
A sense of importance.
You kept reminding me:

“Don’t sink too deeply.”
You tried pulling me up.

I didn’t understand —
Was it a test?
For me.

Keeping me up late at night
So I’d fall deeper.
But it wasn’t love
Or friendship —
It was humanity,
You said to me.

I flowed with the current
You gave me.
Told you what I felt.

This isn’t a love story.
It’s just pure friendship —
And curiosity.

I waited to talk.
And maybe...
Maybe I won’t be lost next time,
If I see and feel again.

Seeing you
Was like walking into
A garden full of beautiful flowers.
And I —
I was the unique thorny one
In the middle.

The words I heard
Keep echoing:
“Was I a good person?”
You kept saying I was.

Maybe you're just too good
That you see good in others.

But the dark side I hide —
It’s not dark.
It’s the darkest.

So don’t come near me.
Don't look at the fear in me.
It’s growing.
Still growing.

Maybe it's my mistake —
The one that keeps pulling me back.
This insecurity of lagging behind
Is all I ever see.

The sweet, funny words
You said to me —
Maybe it’s just me,
Distancing.

The long nights
Felt short while talking.
But my sleepy mind
Keeps dimming.

I just want to improve.
To not be left out —
That’s all I feel.

Let me tell you something:

You are the first person
I’ve ever written something deep for.

You —
Hardworking,
Funny,
The brightest person I see.

Maybe you feel the same too.
A depressing feeling,
Ringing through.

Maybe you cried once,
With no one to lean on.
I felt that too.

And maybe —
That feeling left you
After talking to someone
You trusted.

You block the view from others.
They see something —
But I still don’t understand
What you really feel
About me.

Is it friendship
That I see?
Or is it just
Humanity
That you feel?
