A feelings mine,
Seems I can't hide inside.

A cruel world, I lived in,
Once had joy, now lost in din.
A happy home — now street and sigh,
The one , We loved by.

A fellig of love inside 
Where have they gone, 
Inside a void, God used to reside,

But we drifted far from heaven 
From that love , that peace
Once we hold like a string of life.

From love to greed, from light to dark,
Where once their was love 
Now all I see is greed.

A tree was struct by
Both storm and rain,
Still stand tall,
But once in its shadow 
Cut it for light.

A sorrowed cry in endless night,
A longful night sky,
waiting for the person to bring me light.

I'd rather die than live ,
That side of life 
Even I am at the lowest point of my life.

Yes, I'd harm, if that's to live —
I will rather kill 
To keep this breath I hate to give.
I have a mouth to feed,
My life to live.

My own weakness 
My eyes, my curse — I can’t see clear,
I forgot my friend who stood so near.

Don’t take my sight, I beg, I plea,
I will competely lost in it,
Everything on sites,

Maybe I will be
The worst criminal ,
That ever lived by.

Once a beautiful eye,
Full of love,
Now is filled with tears and regret.

Still thinking, maybe they were right.
We are at the wrong time.

Maybe a divine punishment from past life...
Then let me tell you all:
I was the sovereign of the darkest night.

Begged for love,
Begged for life.
What's left to beg?
Maybe a peaceful night.

Hey—
Do you know me?
The real me inside?
The garden full of scars and battles,
I fought to live my life.

Even though that does not seem much—
You were right.
Every soul, new pain...
How much do I have left to die?

Every time I wake up
And see that peaceful night,
I was glad to be here
Rather than that roadside.

But some part of me has a thinking:
Will I be fine?

I once looked at a small girl—
Happiness was on her face,
Even though
Her face was distorted
By her parents—
She was the happiest person
I have seen all my life.

Then I looked at my dream girl.
She was just like her.
I misunderstood her
For the reason
She doesn't show her real side.

Ha—words.
Like I was illiterate.
She just shows that side to her friend.
Maybe I wanted it to be
Beside her best friend.

Now I see the real side of world.
I seem like an ant,
Just continuing struggling,
Even though I don’t have pain.

I was at the point
Where I was overthinking.
Some of my friends tried to give me light.
She was also like me.
I think we needed a therapist to live a life.

Every person—
Different nature defined by birth.
I was never in a place to judge.

I was just a random person,
Struggling to live and see
What’s around.
Maybe that girl
Has already lived that life.

A peaceful girl, a cheerful girl, a normal girl...
An overthinking girl, a happiest girl,
A hidden girl.
What’s the kind I’ve left to see?
Maybe it’s time to find myself in me.

The boys were also different—
The same suffering, struggle.
The same was me,
With just the interests different.
I was the exception to every case—
That a person can live a peaceful life.
