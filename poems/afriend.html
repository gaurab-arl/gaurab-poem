A friend for a moment, a stranger in the next,
Just behind my back, a sound keeps echoing.
I listen—
Yet I don't seem to care.

A hidden story, like a river,
Flowing only to draw near.
Near me, the land shifted—
And I slipped away.
I jumped into the river,
It wouldn't let me see my face,
As fear pulled me under.

A mirror—it keeps staring at me,
Like a fly that won't fly away.
It seems to like me quite a lot,
Even though it's just a fish
That slips away.

"I try. I strive...
But how can I hope,
When even gods cannot survive?"

The survival game we play—
With faces that change like tides.
Change the person,
And I change too.

A new self for everyone.
Just choose and select the interface
I lost me , In caring too much
For everyone else.
