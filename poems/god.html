The God I served,
The one I remembered in hard times,
The one I forgot
When joy was mine.

Please help me—
My mind is eating my inner peace.
Peace detaches,
And I am falling.

Falling into the place
You called hell.
I was thrown from the main gate,
Yet the demons welcomed me—
With warm smiles in hell.

The face I wear
Looks just like theirs.
Now they see me
As one of their own.

The sins I’ve committed
Cannot be cleared
Without sacrifice.

The only thing they ask in return—
My loved ones.
And I accepted…
Because I saw none left,
Except a few—
The ones God chose to protect.

So I leave them in Your hands.
Instead, punish me.
May You see their innocent faces,
Reflections of inner peace.

I made promises—
Many.
But never fulfilled even one.
Do You see me as ignorant,
Or just selfish?

The promises I broke,
The things I did
When I was broken…
I remember them all—
Crystal clear.

Sometimes I fear.
Sometimes I dear.
Every time I was given a chance,
I wasted it.

But now,
None seem to remain.

It seems, God,
You’ve forgotten me—
Thought I never existed.

But I know the feeling of peace
That comes
When I think of You.

My mind is fragile—
Like a feather in the wind,
Flying wherever
It feels right.

The things worth remembering.
The moments we lived.

The bad habits I formed.
The distance between.

The fate I once held.
The fate I now face.

The mistakes I made.
The truths I failed.

The masks we wear,
The masks we made
To speak and smile
Among strangers,
Thats my fate.

Yet, the real me—
Hidden inside—
You seem to see it all.

Why don’t You try it too?
Maybe we can be friends,
Until next play.

You seemed to have known:
The child,
The adult,
And the one growing in between.

Now the old me
Is beginning to rise.
My time is coming.

The demons…
They are calling.
