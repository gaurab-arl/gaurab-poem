Healing… a magic spell in fantasy to recover wounds.
In science, it’s cells repairing.
In emotion?
It’s... to be happy again. Haha.

But am I always depressed? , No.
Sometimes, I do see myself smiling.
Why?
Maybe because of a girl.
Maybe a friend.
Maybe family.
who knows.

I feel like I’m both poison and medicine.
Poison—because I can be a burden.
Medicine—because sometimes, I help myself heal.

Time plays a part.
Healing was like wrapping a wound in bandages made of time.
It doesn’t remove the pain.
It just… hides it.

Hiding was the only option for ,
Me.
            
Sometimes I feel happy talking to someone—
But maybe it’s only me.
Maybe for them, it’s different.
Emotion? Feeling?
I haven’t figured it out.

It’s like a trap. Or an addiction.
At first, it feels lucky.
Later… who knows?

Some people scratch their wounds just to see them again.
Curious.
Some wrap them so tightly,
they forget the wound is even there.
Is that healing?
Or just hiding?

Healing magic…
That's all we want in life.
But it's imaginary.

What is “healing”?
I don’t know.

People see pain in different ways—
Some think you’re broken.
Some call you depressed.
Some say you're frustrated.
Others, a coward.

Maybe someone out there…
gets it.
Someone I haven’t found yet.
Someone I can’t see.
