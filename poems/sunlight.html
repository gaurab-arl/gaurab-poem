Phase of Seeing

I was the candle,
You were the night.
I burned for you—
Yet you longed for sunlight.

The dream I have been dreaming
Will be fulfilled by someone
Unknown to me.

The absence I faced,
The weight I wear,
Is suffocating the heart inside me.

Where are you?
I am searching.
The pain you have given me
Is surfacing.

The night I have been dreaming,
The hand I once held—
Is leaving.
The future I am seeing
Is darkening.

The sunlight you are going toward
Is burning.

The endless stories
I once listened to—
Are ending.
The story where I once was
Is scattering.

The smile I see by my side
Is disappearing.
The tears I once hidden
Are coming.
The love I gave to her
Is longing.

It feels like a god's blessing—
That I can’t see you
Anymore than this.

The comfort I give
Is the warm feeling,
Like a sunset
I am setting.

What’s the stage we are in?
I think it is the phase
Of seeing.
