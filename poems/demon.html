Anger I feel,
It’s telling me things.
A demon is awakening,
Feels like it’s staring at me.

Wanted to eat me,
With only bones left behind.
Is that you, my friend, behind
The demon I am facing?

I am going to become a hollow,
To have nothing left to swallow.
May I become a snake,
With only fangs shown.

I have another me, you see—
With the same thing I have with me.
That’s my friend,
Which may be inner me or a real person, I think.

I...
Didn’t like that much,
Because he seems to do
Things I didn’t like.

Always likes to show things.
I don’t understand him,
Even a little bit.

An angry thought
Always seems to be in his
Mind
Whenever he sees me.

Things have changed a bit.
A feeling of not knowing was present before—
But now,
Hatred is what I am feeling.

What’s the reason behind it?
Is it the girl?
Or the mistakes you've been showing?

Please forget about the useless thing.
You may be a wheel
In a world of game—
You may never be part of it.

Do you know a story of three cats?
Where, in the fight between two,
The third always wins it?

To get what you want,
You need to be sure.
Don’t tell anybody about it—
You may be a river that never flows.

You follow the tide.
I bypass it.
Well, the difference is—
You care for the tides,
I move away from it.

The girl—
He seems to like her.
Found out about it...
What an interesting play of events.
I see someone doubting
And distancing.

Are you a spy or a detective?
Really—don’t be possessive.

Well, you can dream of things
That can’t be true.
A feeling so sorrowed,
It only knows how to borrow.

A borrowed feeling has grown into an adult—
Now doesn’t know how to control.
Just let a girl be at the side.
He will open like a broken dam to flow.

My friend,
I see the demon in you,
Growing old,
Ever stronger than before.
Maybe you've forgotten the world
Was never yours.

I am also including me.
I was out of the world—
Never wanting to go inside, and never will.
But I will continue to see it.

Trying to break things,
Never caring about any.
Looks like you’ve failed to become a special person
After seeing her with someone happy.

Don’t be like a damn joker
And expect things
Which will never succeed.

Like an eclipse—
It only shows once a year.
It only exists.

You are like that:
Only come, darken the world,
And then gone
Next time I see it.

The things you said are very true,
And I know it.
But what’s the end and beginning of a person
If all of them are on Earth, happy—
And you are seeing them from
Hell, where devils think?

The things you spend
Come back to you—
Maybe harming you.

If you die,
I will come and take you
Far from heaven,
Where you can't see.
May that be your eternal eternity.
