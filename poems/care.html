Let Me Burn

I feel,
I see,
I get it—
The friendship… I have it.

Why do you care for me?
I don’t deserve
The flood of care
You keep pouring into me.

I misunderstood you,
So deeply.
The child inside you—
Calling to me.

The humming,
The sweetness,
The innocence I feel...

Like a lost child
Coming to me,
Asking how I was—
As if I were your family.

But even as I hurt,
Even as I burn,
Don’t come and ask me.
I won’t say a thing.

I don’t ever want you to see
The worst of my time.
I will be buried with it.
Don’t feel burdened—
Please, live free.

Don’t try to console me.
I’ll break beneath your feeling.

And I’ll serve you
Wholeheartedly,
Until you feel
Annoyed
By me.

Don’t call me—
I won’t answer it.
And if I do,
I won’t be able
To control
The turbulence
My inner world is facing.

I am burning
With this feeling inside.
Ice mountains
Are melting with me.

Whether I swim—
Or drown—
Depends on me.

Don’t try
To come with me.
I can’t help you swim.

Let me drown—
And save yourself
From me.

Even as I suffer,
I won’t tell a soul.
I already know the answer.
So don’t expect
Me
To fall.
