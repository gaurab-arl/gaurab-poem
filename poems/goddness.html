        <div class="poem-content">
Someone with a half-open door inside,
Waiting for someone to arrive.
Searching for a butterfly —
One that never stays in sight.

The fear of losing hides within,
But can't be shown around love.
Hope for support fills the mind,
Yet that someone was lost —
To another, kind and kind.

Filled with the aroma of expectation,
A ritual of sacred love in silent connection.
Untold stories, heavy with pain,
A friendship that breathes through hidden strain.

The nature of six paths, the blend of two,
Formed something unreal —
In a small, quiet room.
A sacred place, where nature flows,
And emotions bloom in those who know.
