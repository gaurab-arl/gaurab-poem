          <h2>Hi, I’m Gaurab Aryal</h2>
          <p>
            I’m an engineering student who spends equal time debugging code and
            untangling thoughts. I build games, websites, and small tools —
            but poetry is where I experiment with emotions instead of logic.
            I like creating things that feel personal, whether it’s a program
            or a line of verse.
          </p>

            “Sometimes I code to escape reality.  
            Sometimes I write to face it.”

        <h3>My Writing</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t start writing because I planned to be a poet.
          It began after being inspired by someone. Poetry became a way
          to process confusion, loneliness, admiration, and questions.
          
          My themes often revolve around identity, distance,
          quiet observations, and the strange weight of existing
          in crowded spaces while feeling unseen.

        <h3>About This Site</h3>
        <p>
          This website is both a portfolio and a playground.
          It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          designed and coded from scratch.  
          Features include dynamic poem pages, search,
          filtering, pagination, and theme styling.
          It reflects my interest in web development,
          UI design.
